Former president Donald Trump said Monday that the FBI had raided his Mar-a-Lago Club and searched his safe — activity related to an investigation into the potential mishandling of classified documents, according to two people familiar with the probe. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss its details, said agents were conducting a court-authorized search as part of a long-running investigation of whether documents — some of them top-secret — were taken to the former president’s private golf club and residence instead of sent to the National Archives when Trump left office. That could be a violation of the Presidential Records Act, which requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president’s official duties.

Searching a former president’s property to look for possible evidence of a crime is highly unusual and would require approval at the top levels of the Justice Department. It represents a historic moment in Trump’s tortured relationship with the Justice Department, both in and out of the White House.

A department spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether Attorney General Merrick Garland approved the search. The FBI also declined to comment.

In a lengthy statement in which he equated the raid to Watergate, Trump accused the FBI of “even” breaking into his safe. He provided no further details on what federal agents were looking for, or what else happened during their visit.

“My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said in a statement released through his political action committee, Save America.

Trump said the raid was “unannounced” and claimed it was not “necessary or appropriate.” The former president, without evidence, accused Democrats of weaponizing the “justice system” against him.

Many Republican lawmakers and political candidates also reacted with outrage Monday night, declaring the search of Mar-a-Lago a politically motivated attack intended to impede Trump’s chances if he runs for president again.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is poised to possibly become speaker should Republicans win the majority in November’s midterm elections, vowed to launch oversight investigations into the Justice Department.

“The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” he said on Twitter. “Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar.”

The president of the FBI Agents Association, Brian O’Hare, issued a broad defense of the investigators who carry out court-approved searches, without commenting specifically on the Trump case.

O’Hare said search warrants are issued by federal judges, “must satisfy detailed and clear procedural rules, and are the product of collaboration and consultation with relevant Department of Justice attorneys.”

FBI agents, he added, “perform their investigative duties with integrity and professionalism, and remain focused on complying with the law and the Constitution.”

Trump nominated the current head of the FBI, Christopher A. Wray, to the position in 2017, after firing the previous FBI director, James B. Comey, amid a probe into whether any Trump campaign advisers had conspired with Russian operatives to influence the 2016 election.

But Trump’s relationship with Wray also soured, and the president considered firing him on multiple occasions, former advisers said. Through most of Trump’s presidency, the two men had limited interactions.

Mar-a-Lago is closed in the hot months of Florida’s summer, and Trump’s advisers said he was not there on Monday when the search involving more than a dozen FBI agents was conducted. Trump advisers said a coterie of agents arrived Monday morning and left by late afternoon. There were few Trump employees around, but the Secret Service was present.

The former president has spent much of the summer at Bedminster, his golf resort in New Jersey. But on Monday he was in New York, according to a person familiar with his whereabouts. Trump’s team was given no heads-up about the search, several advisers said. There was no indication the FBI had searched any of Trump’s other properties, and advisers said law enforcement had not.

Evan Corcoran, a lawyer representing Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In January, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents and other items from Mar-a-Lago that Archives officials said should have been turned over when Trump left the White House.

“The Presidential Records Act is critical to our democracy, in which the government is held accountable by the people,” David S. Ferriero, then the archivist of the United States, said in a statement in February.

At the time, Ferriero said in a statement that Trump representatives were “continuing to search” for additional records. Trump was resistant to giving over the records for months, advisers said at the time.

Some of the materials Trump took included letters and notes from foreign leaders, such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.

The inventory of unclassified items in the boxes that were recovered earlier this year from Mar-a-Lago is roughly 100 pages long, according to a person familiar with that document. Descriptions of items that were improperly taken to Mar-a-Lago include a cocktail napkin, a phone list, charts, slide decks, letters, memos, maps, talking points, a birthday dinner menu, schedules and more, this person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the ongoing investigation.

There is a separate inventory for just the classified materials that were taken to the former president’s Florida residence, this person said. If the unclassified version of the classified inventory were organized in the same way as the inventory of nonclassified items, it would be about three pages long, according to this person.

“It’s important to note that volume is only one way to quantify the documents that were taken,” the person added. “But just one page — or one portion of highly sensitive information — being improperly released can cause great national security harm.”

As for classification level, they range from confidential to top-secret to special handling categories, the person added.

It was not immediately clear on Monday why FBI agents would conduct a search related to the documents many months after the 15 boxes of material were retrieved. A sitting president is the top classification authority in the government, giving that person far more leeway than most government employees in deciding what is and isn’t classified.

Advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump’s actions, have said that he mishandled documents for years, largely by ripping them up. They described an ad hoc packing process at the end of his term, in which Trump and his family took boxes of material that should have gone to the National Archives. The Archives only learned some of the material was missing after it tried to locate items for cataloguing.

Trump advisers have denied any bad intent, saying the boxes contained mementos from his presidency.

The search of Trump’s home is the most aggressive to date by federal agents and prosecutors examining the conduct of the president and his inner circle of advisers.

Separate from the investigation into the handling of documents, a federal grand jury in Washington has been gathering information about efforts by Trump lawyers and advocates to try to use fake electors to block Joe Biden from formally becoming president after the 2020 election.

As part of that investigation, authorities have begun examining Trump’s actions, seeking to understand, at a minimum, what instructions he gave to subordinates, according to people familiar with the investigation.

Federal investigators are also working up from their criminal investigations of the hundreds of Trump supporters who took part in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot to see who, if anyone, tried to orchestrate violence to stop the formal congressional ceremony confirming Biden’s election victory.

It was not immediately clear on Monday whether the Justice Department has moved before to search the residence of a former president. In June 1975, Richard M. Nixon did meet behind closed doors with Watergate prosecutors and two grand jurors near his home in San Clemente, Calif. — 10 months after leaving the White House and after he was pardoned by his successor, President Gerald Ford.

Following lengthy negotiations, Nixon spent 11 hours over two days providing testimony to a federal grand jury investigating the Watergate break-in and coverup.

4,Top Republicans echo Trump’s evidence-free claims to discredit FBI search,"Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Top Republicans on Monday rallied quickly behind Donald Trump’s efforts to discredit the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago Club, embracing his claims, presented without evidence, that it was a political attack intended to impede Trump’s chances if he runs for president again. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a top Trump ally, responded with a threat to the Justice Department, vowing to investigate the agency if the Republicans win back the House in the midterm elections. Claiming without evidence that the department has “reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” McCarthy warned, “Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar.”

The quick defense of Trump and combative posture by leading Republican officeholders and potential 2024 presidential aspirants underlined the former president’s status as a standard-bearer in the party, even as he was tainted anew by another investigation. With fewer than 100 days before the midterm elections, many Republicans continue to rally around Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, his baseless attacks on a slew of officeholders and his divisive rhetoric.

Democrats, meanwhile, weighed in more slowly, applauding the news of the search and urging the Justice Department to fully investigate the former president’s handling of classified information. “Good!” tweeted House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) in response to the news.

Many of the Republicans aghast at the FBI raid had supported FBI probes of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server in 2016. When then-FBI Director James B. Comey found no reason to charge Clinton after an initial investigation, and after another probe of emails on a laptop belonging to a Clinton aide shortly before the election, they asked whether the Democrat had gotten off easy.

“Secretary Clinton’s fundamental lack of judgment and wanton disregard for protecting and keeping information confidential raises continued questions about the exposure of our nation’s diplomatic and national security secrets,” McCarthy said in 2016, after Comey initially announced the end of the investigation.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a onetime Trump critic turned Trump defender during the 45th president’s tenure, said Monday on Twitter: “We’re 100 days away from midterm elections. President Trump is likely going to run again in 2024.” He added, “Launching such an investigation of a former President this close to an election is beyond problematic.”

Six years earlier, however, Graham was critical of the FBI after it found no crime to charge in its probe of Clinton’s email server.

“We need a special prosecutor, someone outside the Justice Department, to look into this matter,” said Graham in an August 2016 interview on Fox News, 75 days before that year’s presidential election. “If you’re waiting on this Justice Department to hold anybody in the Obama-Clinton world accountable, you’ll die of old age. It’s sad but it’s true.”

A person familiar with the investigation related to the search of Trump’s safe at Mar-a-Lago, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss its details, said agents were conducting a court-authorized search as they probe the potential mishandling of classified documents that were shipped to Mar-a-Lago. The FBI declined to comment.

Trump nominated the current head of the FBI, Christopher A. Wray, to the position in 2017, after firing Comey amid a probe of whether any Trump campaign advisers had conspired with Russian operatives to influence the 2016 election.

Trump likened the FBI search of his home to an assault that “could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries” and compared it to Watergate, when allies of President Richard Nixon illegally broke into the offices of the Democratic National Committee. Republican lawmakers seized on the former president’s rhetoric, casting the search, without evidence, as federal government overreach against a political adversary.

“This was a strange day,” Trump said during a telerally for former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, a congressional candidate, on Monday night, calling it “another day in paradise.”

Trump and the Republican National Committee quickly sought to capitalize on the search as a fundraising opportunity, sending out texts to supporters that referred to “Biden’s FBI” or “Biden’s Department of Justice.”

Trump was at Trump Tower in New York on Monday with limited staff, according to three advisers, and learned of the search only after the FBI was at the property, one adviser who spoke to him said. The advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private interactions.

Democrats, who had twice impeached Trump but failed both times to convict him, welcomed the news of the raid. Some cheered that there was enough evidence against the former president for a court-approved search warrant of his private property.

Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said that Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents put “our security at risk” and that she is “committed to getting to the bottom of President Trump’s potentially serious misconduct and advancing critical reforms to prevent these abuses in the future and protect our national security.”

Some Democrats accused Trump and Republicans of hypocrisy after their years of attempting to prosecute their political enemies. Many Democrats tweeted that no one, not even a former president, is “above the law.”

“This man and his fellow bootlickers hid under a rock rather than respond every time Donald Trump called for persecution, investigation, imprisonment, or violence against his political opponents,” said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), referring to McCarthy’s statement. “These same people talk about Trump like he’s above the law. He’s not above the law.”

Advertisement

Other Democrats reveled in the news that the FBI was moving forward with its investigation and said it imperiled Trump’s political prospects.

“Might Trump be questioning his ever running for office. He is facing so many legal troubles and has engaged in a multitude of questionable(understatement) acts that make him vulnerable in so many different forums and jurisdictions. He has more avenues to prison than Al Capone did,” tweeted Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.).

The surprise raid, related to an investigation into Trump’s possible mishandling of classified information, adds another potential factor to the midterm elections. A string of political wins for Democrats in recent weeks had begun to temper GOP optimism about winning back control of Congress because of President Biden’s low approval ratings, rising prices and concerns about crime.

Some Republican strategists argued that the investigation gives Trump and his allies a new chance to play the victim, but it is also a reminder to voters of the baggage he carries. In recent months, the party’s operatives and donors have said that Republican voters are moving away from backing Trump in 2024 — even as he leads in the polls — not because they don’t like him but because they believe it is time for new blood.

“I just hope DOJ fully appreciates all that it’s biting off here. Whether they want it to be or not, it’s going to become extraordinarily political,” said Brendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and a frequent Trump critic. “It would be in their interest to communicate very clearly what has happened and why. Regardless, the right is going to lose its mind, and Trump will again play the victim card to great effect.”

Republicans, even those with an eye on the White House in 2024, were swift in their condemnation of the raid and rallied behind Trump, firing off similar evidence-free statements.

“The FBI raid on President Trump’s home is an unprecedented political weaponization of the Justice Department,” tweeted South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem. “They’ve been after President Trump as a candidate, as President, and now as a former President. Using the criminal justice system in this manner is un-American.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), also echoing Trump’s rhetoric, said the raid was akin to political persecution seen in “3rd world Marxist dictatorships.”

And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is considered one of Trump’s biggest potential rivals if both men run in 2024, synthesized the GOP’s main grievances.

“The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves. Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic,” DeSantis wrote on Twitter.

Across social media and in statements, some Republicans’ characterizations of the raid attempted to paint a dystopian picture of America.

“If you’re a Republican with any kind of voice, and not speaking up for President Trump tonight don’t expect any of us to speak up for you when your time comes,” tweeted Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), a far-right member of Congress. “You may not realize it yet, but they’re coming for all of us.”

5,The GOP’s inauspicious knee-jerk reaction to the Trump raid,"Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One day, relatively soon, the heads of the Justice Department and the FBI are likely to be brought to Capitol Hill to testify about the historic decision to raid a former president’s home. For now, though, we don’t yet know much about what was in the search warrant used to raid Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago on Monday. We do know that the raid concerned the removal of classified documents from the White House and that, according to Trump, agents raided his safe.

But we also quickly found out that a lot of influential people are rather uninterested in any of that, reflexively shouting “witch hunt” and baselessly blaming President Biden for the raid in a way that bodes very poorly for whatever comes next in this process. Trump has marshaled his army of supporters to declare, in knee-jerk fashion, any legal scrutiny of him a deep-state operation.

Advertisement

It’s also an army that, it bears noting, was once quite consumed with the import of document security by would-be presidential candidates — and quite happy to promote the idea that their preferred candidate ought to “lock” such an opponent “up.”

Trump immediately likened the raid to what happens in third-world countries. Plenty happily echoed that talking point, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the House Judiciary Committee’s Republicans, led by Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio). “Doesn’t the FBI have better things to do than harass the former PRESIDENT?” read a tweet from the House Judiciary GOP’s account.

This is what happens in third world countries.



Not the United States.



Doesn’t the FBI have better things to do than harass the former PRESIDENT? https://t.co/XoP6hz5hDR — House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) August 8, 2022

Another talking point promoted by the House Judiciary GOP and Fox News commentators was the idea that, if they could go after Trump like this, nobody is safe.

Many blamed Biden — Fox News’s Brian Kilmeade went so far as to say that the order for the raid “has to have come from @POTUS and/or someone in White House” — despite there being zero evidence the president had any role.

The responses from the highest levels of the GOP soon arrived, and they were equally pitched.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) assured Monday night that Garland had better be prepared to answer questions. But even without any of those questions answered, McCarthy declared: “The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.” The Republican National Committee declared that “Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans. This raid is outrageous.”

Attorney General Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. pic.twitter.com/dStAjnwbAT — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) August 9, 2022

That’s a lot of firm conclusions based on not much at all. But it’s the fruit of years of Trump claiming persecution.

First there was the Russia investigation, which, it turned out, included plenty of evidence of potential obstruction of justice and even coordination with Russians — per a report by the then-GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee — but is now shorthand for a classic “witch hunt” on the right. There was the Ukraine impeachment, which ended with Trump being acquitted but included plenty of remarkable details about using foreign policy to benefit his reelection. Lastly was Jan. 6, which many top Republicans initially acknowledged was very bad and even blamed Trump, only to acquit him at his second impeachment trial on a technicality and quickly revert to standing by Trump when it was clear he was going nowhere politically.

Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that this investigation hardly comes out of nowhere: Trump’s handling of government documents has long been a focal point. The Washington Post reported as far back as February on Trump’s “relentless document destruction habits.” A couple of days later, the National Archives confirmed that it had retrieved 15 boxes of documents from Mar-a-Lago — including records marked as “classified” and even “top secret” — that should have been turned over, and then asked the Justice Department to investigate, which it clearly has.

The question from there is whether this is a matter that merits a search warrant. That the Justice Department would go this route would seem to suggest it sees something potentially incriminating beyond merely shoddy record-keeping and document retention. The department knows this decision will be harshly scrutinized; going down this path only for its destination to be a minor finding, ending in a slap on the wrist, isn’t worth the blowback it’ll get from 40 to 45 percent of the country.

It also bears noting that this portion of the country was once quite laser-focused on keeping tabs on potentially sensitive government documents. Trump’s best attack on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign was her private email server. Many of those who raised alarm bells about that were very quiet when we learned that government documents had made their way to Mar-a-Lago. (McCarthy, for one, had lambasted Clinton for what he called her “fundamental lack of judgment and wanton disregard for protecting and keeping information confidential” back in 2016.)

Then there’s the matter of supposed political targeting by the Justice Department and the baseless allegations about Biden’s supposed involvement. During the 2016 campaign, Trump encouraged supporters to chant “lock her up” over Clinton’s emails. He had very little compunction about using his power as president to investigate political adversaries, including on Ukraine. And whatever you think of how the Clinton investigation turned out, there was an investigation — a quite public one, involving a presidential candidate in the heat of a campaign, which might well have turned the 2016 election.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, offered a somewhat more measured response on Monday night. He complained about the proximity of the raid to the midterm elections and cited supposed overreach in past Trump probes. But he also said that “no one is above the law” and added, “time will tell regarding this most recent investigation” into Trump.

Time will tell regarding this most recent investigation.



However, launching such an investigation of a former President this close to an election is beyond problematic. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 9, 2022

That latter sentiment seemed reasonable. By that early juncture, though, his party had already passed him by, deciding it wasn’t worth waiting for time to tell us anything.

6,"Inside Biden’s hot streak, from the poolside to the Capitol","Listen 12 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

President Biden sat by the White House pool on Saturday, taking in the Washington heat and phoning senators as his long-stalled economic agenda was on the brink of passing the Senate. It was a heady but fragile moment, and Biden — who had carefully kept his distance from the talks until now — wasn’t leaving anything to chance. He called Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner (Va.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Tina Smith (Minn.), among others, urging them onward and praising their work on the final details of the health, climate and tax bill at the center of his domestic agenda.

In the end, the bill’s passage by the Senate on Sunday capped off a remarkable three-week stretch for Biden, much of which coincided with his covid isolation, including the passage of major bills to help sick veterans and boost computer chip makers; historic job growth numbers; steadily falling gas prices; a once-in-a-generation expansion of NATO; and the long-sought killing of al-Qaeda’s leader. The House is scheduled to vote on the economic package Friday, with Democratic leaders confident they have the votes.

But such win streaks have not been the rule for Biden, who has faced low approval ratings and cascading crises. His challenge now, supporters say, is to turn this hot streak into a pivot point that reorients his presidency and energizes Democrats, rather than a brief uptick in an otherwise difficult term. That means persuading voters that these wins matter not just to Biden but to them.

The recent successes “have probably converted what would have been a Category 5 storm to a Category 3 storm for Democrats,” said David Axelrod, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. “And that’s a big difference.”

But it will only matter if Democrats pound on GOP vulnerabilities, he added. “They’ve made some really significant strides in the last few weeks, but they also have to contrast that with the portrait that’s growing of the Republicans as a party in the thrall of extremists,” Axelrod said. Republicans have faced backlash for actions such as opposing caps on insulin costs and initially blocking a veterans’ health bill.

The turnaround on the budget bill, Biden’s most startling victory, was the result of a decision to reverse himself sharply and let senators negotiate among themselves, rather than playing a leading role himself — not an easy move for a self-declared master of the Senate. After earlier negotiations with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-Va.) blew up in December, Biden directed his staff not to disclose the details of any interactions with members of Congress to take himself out of the public picture.

“One of the lessons learned — a big lesson learned — was that letting the negotiations with senators dominate the public conversation was a mistake, because it made it so that disagreements about minutiae became what the public consumed, instead of how pieces of legislation were going to impact people’s lives,” said Jen Psaki, Biden’s former White House press secretary. “Sometimes the best things happen in the dark, away from the public.”

This story is based on interviews with 14 White House officials, members of Congress, Democratic strategists and others close to the White House, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

In addition, Democrats hope the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade will energize voters alarmed by what they call the extremism of the Republican Party — a hope boosted by Kansas voters’ recent decisive rejection of an antiabortion measure. And they contend that the budget bill — which provides incentives for clean energy and lets Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices — will alleviate many Americans’ daily struggles.

“This is the most significant action that a Congress and the president can take to address inflation and deliver meaningful relief to American families,” White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said. “With respect to addressing inflation, taking on the issues of prescription drugs, taking on the issues of climate change and energy security — I think that legislation is going to speak to all of this.”

Republicans, however, said that the bill will do nothing to bring down consumers’ prices anytime soon and that, if anything, its minimum corporate tax will harm the economy.

“I don’t think anything in the last few weeks has changed the dynamics on the ground,” said Chris Hartline, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Hartline said that the economy is still the primary concern for most voters and that between record-high inflation and still-elevated gas prices, the political environment will favor the GOP in November.

“Biden is still historically unpopular, and his agenda is still historically unpopular,” Hartline said. “I think they’re just putting the nail in the coffin.”

The seeds of Biden’s biggest win were planted just a few weeks ago.

On July 14, after months of painstaking negotiation, Manchin told Democratic leaders he would not support an economic package that contained tax increases or new spending on climate change. Instead, Manchin expressed support for proposed health-care care provisions, which would allow Medicare to negotiate the price of some drugs and cap seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $2,000 per year — a hugely popular measure that Democrats have worked toward for decades.

It seemed to spell an unambiguous end to Democrats’ broader plans. But that night, Manchin called White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, one of Biden’s closest aides, according to a person familiar with the call. Manchin said that he was still interested in securing a deal and that he and Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) were much closer to a compromise than people realized.

That Monday — four days after the negotiations seemed to come apart — Manchin called Ricchetti and Deese. Emotions had cooled over the weekend, and Manchin said he and Schumer were finalizing the deal.

Deese met with the senators’ aides in Manchin’s small hideaway office in the U.S. Capitol to get a sense of what disagreements remained. White House officials were careful not to insert themselves aggressively into the conversation, people familiar with the process said, focusing on keeping the talks alive.

But the budget bill was just one of many balls in the air.

Democrats and Republicans were also closing in on a $280 billion bill to boost domestic computer chip manufacturing and curb China’s influence, a bill that was years in the making and that Biden had been pushing for months. In early July, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had threatened to scuttle the bipartisan Chips and Science Act because he was frustrated by Democrats’ efforts to reach their Democrats-only budget deal.

But the White House saw cracks in McConnell’s position, as key Republican senators issued statements indicating they were open to a scaled-back deal, a White House official said. Then just days after Manchin signaled that the budget deal had collapsed again, the Senate passed the Chips Act, providing $52 billion for U.S. semiconductor makers to build or improve their factories.

But later that day, in a stunning turnabout that caught most of Washington by surprise, Manchin and Schumer announced their stunning breakthrough: Manchin would support roughly $433 billion in new spending, most of which would be focused on climate change and clean energy production, reviving Democrats’ signature domestic bill.

That was significantly scaled back from the $2 trillion bill Biden and Democrats sought last year, but it still marked the biggest climate investment in U.S. history, along with the prescription drug provision and tax changes that would raise $739 billion over the next decade, enough to offset the cost of the bill while securing more than $300 billion for cutting the deficit, a priority for Manchin.

Senate Republicans, who just hours earlier had helped Democrats pass the massive chips bill, were livid and felt Manchin had misled them by suggesting he was done negotiating with his fellow Democrats. The next day, angry Senate Republicans blocked a bill to help veterans who had been exposed to toxic burn pits during their service, attracting a wave of criticism.

White House officials felt that Republicans had blundered badly.

“It showed Republicans’ true colors, that not only are they trying to thwart us — they’re showing they’d cause active harm,” one White House official said. “You’re trying to gut popular bills like veterans exposed to toxins fighting for their country? Those are very powerful arguments they have handed to us.”

On July 28, fresh out of his covid-19 isolation, Biden held an economic event at the White House as the House was scheduled to vote on the chips bill. The margin could be tight, Democrats worried — House GOP leaders were urging their members to vote against it in an effort to deny Biden a legislative win.

In the green room before the White House event, Biden told his personal aide, Stephen Goepfert, to keep him updated minute-by-minute on the vote. At about 3 p.m., as the roundtable with business executives was underway, Goepfert appeared from backstage and handed Biden a note: The House was on track to pass the bill.

“The House has passed it,” Biden announced to applause. In the end, 24 Republicans defied leadership and backed the measure.

Two days later, on July 30, Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, called him with triumphant news. On a secure phone, he informed Biden that a “precision strike” to kill al-Qaeda’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, appeared to be successful. National security officials believed they had managed to take out Zawahiri without civilian casualties, but they were still making sure.

Days later, Senate Republicans reversed course on the burn pits bill, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.

Klobuchar said the Republicans’ missteps and Democrats’ achievements were adding up to a new political mood.

“You have two things happening at once,” she said. “You have a veil that’s been lifted in part because of the Supreme Court and Republican extremism. And then you also have at the same time, just that basic things get done and deliver for people.”

While the activity was unfolding on Capitol Hill, an event was underway in Kansas that few had predicted.

The ballot measure facing voters Aug. 2 — asking whether abortion protections should be stripped from the state constitution — would be the first major political test of how voters would react to the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling. The Democratic National Committee used some of Biden’s volunteer army to organize in Kansas without letting Biden’s involvement become part of a broader national story, which could repel voters in the deep-red state, a Biden adviser said.

Unexpectedly, Kansas voters resoundingly rejected the measure, as roughly 60 percent voted to maintain abortion protections. Turnout for the primary election far exceeded other contests in recent years, giving Democrats hope that the issue would motivate voters in November.

Then by Saturday, it looked like Biden’s long-sought health-and-climate package was nearing passage. As senators voted through the day and all night Saturday, Ricchetti and White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain stayed up through most night to watch the process play out, talking to Biden about every half an hour. Ricchetti called Biden early Sunday morning as the president departed the White House for his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Del.

One key provision in the health-care portion of the bill — a $35 cap on the price of insulin for many patients — was stripped away by Senate Republicans.

Still, the vote pressed on, and by Sunday afternoon, several hours after Biden arrived at his home in Rehoboth Beach, the Senate passed the bill, sending it to the House for final passage.

In some sense, the groundwork was laid several months ago. When Biden held a news conference last January to mark his first year in office, his final answer to a reporter’s question signaled a recognition that he’d made mistakes and was determined to take a different approach.

“The public doesn’t want me to be the ‘President Senator.’ They want me to be the president, and let senators be senators,” Biden said. “If I’ve made a mistake, I’m used to negotiating to get things done, and I’ve been in the past relatively successful at it in the United States Senate, even as vice president. But I think that the role of president is a different role.”

7,"Brandon returns, darkly: Democrats turn an insult into a pro-Biden meme","Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

It’s not President Biden as many have come to know him. He’s not the aviator-wearing average Joe with familiar family folkisms, the grandpa who plays with his dogs, the ice cream aficionado. In one image, he is in a lifeguard chair, lightning bolts coming out of his hands as he declares, “Let there be jobs!” In another, he’s sitting in a chair that evokes Game of Thrones. In yet more, his eyes are glowing with lasers, or he is bearded and wearing an eye patch. At times there is rubble in his wake.

Meet Dark Brandon.

Over the past few weeks, Democrats have attempted to co-opt one of the most searing catchphrases that Republicans have pinned on Biden, turning the “Let’s go, Brandon” meme around and reclaiming it as their own version of Biden fan fiction.

The new liberal-driven meme is meant to depict Biden as having superpowers, able to smite an al-Qaeda leader and pass legislation through Congress with ease.

Rather than an ineffective president inspiring Republican vitriol and earning historically low approval ratings, he is a superhero familiar with the dark arts and able to change the course of history.

The tone reflects the shift in outlook at the White House, from a struggle to accomplish items on Biden’s agenda to a mood of more swaggering confidence. The imagery, which has roots among anti-Biden users on social media, has quickly gone from some of the far corners of the internet into more mainstream use by administration officials, liberal commentators and U.S. senators.

“Dark Brandon is crushing it,” tweeted deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates, with an image of Biden with pupil-less red eyes and text that reads, “Your malarkey has been going on for long enough, kiddo.”

Rob Flaherty, the White House’s director of digital strategy, also tweeted an image of Biden smiling with red eyes, his hair haloed against a dark background. He did it on his official White House account, he wrote, to ensure that it goes into the historical archives.

Some have added Biden-isms to the memes (“Dark Brandon said ‘here’s the deal’ and then there was a deal,” wrote Megan Apper, a senior adviser in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs at the State Department). Others in the White House have openly ruminated about changing their Twitter biographies to state that they work for “Dark Brandon” rather than the 46th president of the United States.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) posted an image of Dark Brandon after the Senate approved the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a number of key Biden priorities.

Imagery around Biden has taken different forms in recent years. During his time as vice president, the satirical Onion portrayed him as a sort of goofy uncle who washed his car shirtless in the White House driveway, while “Saturday Night Live” imitations played up his toothy smile.

Advertisement

To his supporters, he has often been a cool yet folksy guy wearing aviator sunglasses and driving a Corvette. To his critics, he is the bumbling, gaffe-prone elderly president who recently fell off his bike.

Early in his presidency, the “Let’s go, Brandon” tag tapped into the invective that many Republicans were aiming at Biden.

The phrase originated with a vulgar chant that broke out in October 2021 at Alabama’s Talladega Superspeedway. The crowd was screaming “F--- Joe Biden!,” but an NBC Sports reporter — interviewing NASCAR driver Brandon Brown on air — quipped, “You can hear the chants from the crowd, ‘Let’s go, Brandon!’”

Supporters of Donald Trump claimed that the media was censoring anti-Biden content, the exchange went viral, and a shorthand for vulgarity directed at the president was born.

Yard signs with the phrase were put up. Trump supporters lined streets along Biden’s motorcade holding signs or chanting it. Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.) wrapped up a speech on the House floor by saying, “Let’s go, Brandon,” and it has been the focus of several songs, including one from Kid Rock. Even in Rehoboth Beach, Del., not far from Biden’s vacation home, stores sell T-shirts with the phrase.

Biden himself did not seem aware of the coded phrase. When he and first lady Jill Biden were taking calls on Christmas Eve for the NORAD Santa tracker, one man ended his call by saying, “Merry Christmas, and let’s go, Brandon.”

“Let’s go, Brandon, I agree,” the president responded.

Several months later, during the White House correspondents’ dinner, Biden joked about the phrase. “Republicans seem to support one fella, some guy named Brandon,” he said. “He’s having a really good year, and I’m kind of happy for him.”

The phrase “Let’s go, Brandon” has waxed and waned in popularity among right-wing online influencers since it started in October 2021, according to a Washington Post analysis of political text content on both sides of the political spectrum. Lately, though, it has ticked up again after Trump was greeted with chants of the phrase at a golf tournament, and it’s more frequently used than at the beginning of the year — a trend that perhaps inspired the left to pay attention to the meme again.

The Dark Brandon imagery began to gain traction in March and April, but often in ways that were not complimentary of Biden. That changed over the past week or so, particularly after the killing of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Biden supporters en masse began referring to him as Dark Brandon, with imagery of the president as the shadowy dark lord who authorized a drone strike. Some noted that he was sick with the coronavirus while doing so.

“Dark Brandon strikes again,” wrote one user, with an image of Biden wearing aviators and eating ice cream as a bomb explodes in the background.

They are using a similar aesthetic to Dark MAGA, an online movement that uses imagery of Trump and calls on him to seek political vengeance.

Critics on Monday pointed to what they alleged was Nazi imagery in the background of some of the images. Bates had tweeted a meme that placed Biden — with facial hair and an eye patch — on the movie poster for “The Dark Knight.”

“The Malarkey Will End,” it read. “The Dark Brandon Rises.”

Conservative commentators pointed to the background of the poster, saying it included an image of an eagle that was used as a Nazi symbol.

“So Biden’s Deputy White House Press Secretary, @Andrewjbates46, is posting literal Nazi memes on Twitter and our corrupt media is completely silent about it,” wrote Donald Trump Jr. “I’m sure that if this was a Trump WH staffer, the media would treat it the exact same way and totally ignore it.”

But Tobin Stone, who says he created the meme, said the image was in no way meant to evoke any Nazi elements.

“The eagle is not, and was never intended to be the Reichsadler,” he said in a direct message on Twitter, referring to the “Imperial Eagle” used by, among others, Nazi Germany. “It was just intended to be a representation of America’s national bird, the bald eagle, and any reasonable person should be able to interpret it as such. It was just an eagle, and nothing more.”

Stone said he is a graduate of Albright College in Reading, Pa., in political science and public policy and administration, but he makes posters and does graphic design in his free time. He has created several recent Dark Brandon memes.

“I’m a Democrat — and if we are being honest — the past year since the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been pretty disheartening for Democrats,” he wrote. “Up until this past month, where we’ve been seeing win after win, from the gun bill, to declining gas prices, and now the Inflation Reduction Act finally passing. It’s been great to see so many wins, and celebrating them with these memes that portray Biden as this powerful figure that made it all happen is just good fun.”

White House officials said they wanted to tap into the zeitgeist and saw an opportunity to draw attention to the successes they had last week.

Their base is less active on Twitter — and it was a point of pride during Biden’s campaign that they avoided the policies and conversations that may have been trending on social media — so White House aides have been more selective about when to engage.

But they have also sought to turn perceived negatives around. When Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election, they made the case to Democratic primary voters that Trump was most afraid of facing Biden.

It is unclear, however, whether Biden knows about the new direction the memes about him have taken.

8,"Did Biden keep his pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000","Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

“The mislabeled ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ will do nothing to bring the economy out of stagnation and recession, but it will raise billions of dollars in taxes on Americans making less than $400,000.” — Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, in a news release, July 30

We have long found that complex tax and budget issues are ripe for spin that confuses ordinary readers. Crapo’s comment above is illustrative of a GOP onslaught against the massive bill that was approved in the Senate over the weekend and is up for a vote in the House this week.

At issue is whether President Biden violated his 2020 campaign pledge not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000 a year. Whether this is good tax policy is open to debate, but it was smart politics. During the election campaign, President Donald Trump claimed some 80 times that Joe Biden was going to raise taxes on all or most Americans. Biden had a consistent refrain — that was false, no one making less than $400,000 a year would face higher taxes.

Advertisement

Of course, this kind of memorable pledge is bound to face constant scrutiny from one’s political opponents. Every time various versions of the president’s tax bills were drafted, the administration insisted he was sticking to his pledge.

But Crapo, citing official scorekeeping from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), says Biden broke his pledge.

What’s going on?

The Facts

The bill — which according to our former colleague Steven Pearlstein would do virtually nothing to tame inflation — is a catchall package that includes clean-energy incentives, health-care policies such as an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, additional hiring for the Internal Revenue Service and new corporate taxes. There’s little in the bill that would directly affect people’s tax returns, except for things such as tax credits to buy electric cars or add solar power to homes.

Advertisement

But the corporate tax increases offer some political gold for Republicans. The JCT assumes corporations adjust to a higher tax by reducing investment returns or cutting workers’ wages; it allocates the corporate tax 25 percent to labor and 75 percent to capital. Many other groups that analyze the impact of new tax policies take a similar stance.

The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group, assumes that over time, 60 percent of the corporate income tax is borne by shareholders, 20 percent is borne by capital owners and 20 percent is borne by labor. Those reductions are then reflected in the after-tax income distribution tables, even if none of those lower-wage workers are directly affected by the corporate tax.

There may be indirect effects, however. For instance, workers making less than $400,000 might have equity investments in their 401(k) retirement plans negatively affected by the corporate tax hike.

Advertisement

In any case, for many Americans, even the estimated impact of these “tax increases” is rather small — less than $100 a year — but these tables give Republicans a hook to claim that taxes will rise for just about every income group.

Economists have long debated the impact of corporate taxes on employment. It’s worth noting that because Republicans prefer to cut corporate taxes, these models work in their favor, as the models assume that corporations would raise workers’ wages and thus after-tax income.

Amanda Critchfield, a spokeswoman for the Finance Committee’s GOP staff, acknowledged that the bill would not be felt on people’s tax returns. But she argued that the impact was real.

“If you’re referencing the individual tax rate in the tax code changing, i.e., a change on your tax form, then no — that doesn’t change,” she said in an email. “If you’re talking about people paying more in taxes via tax incidence, then yes — JCT estimates that people will pay more in taxes.”

Advertisement

Critchfield pointed to a working paper published in 2020 by the Bureau of Economic Research that studied the impact of corporate taxes on product prices. It concluded that existing models “significantly underestimate the incidence of corporate taxes on consumers.” The study said that 31 percent of a tax hike is borne by consumers via higher prices, 38 percent is borne by workers via lower wages and 31 percent is borne by owners.

Crapo, at an Aug. 3 news conference, said it was a “technical argument” as to whether Biden’s pledge involved just tax rates. “Technically [the bill is] not raising [middle-class Americans’] tax rates,” he said. “It is raising taxes, and they are paying them — they will be the ones who incur the burden of these taxes.”

In 2020, when this same issue of distributional models emerged, Biden campaign officials said the test was how any tax plan signed into law by Biden would affect individuals when they had to calculate their taxes. They also argued that the models often failed to account for tax proposals that would mitigate the presumed impact of corporate taxes.

Advertisement

The JCT, for instance, initially did not calculate the benefits of consumer tax rebates, health premium subsidies and lower prescription drug costs that the bill hopes to deliver.

“A complete distributional analysis of the full bill would show lower costs or taxes for all but the highest-wealth individuals,” said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. A memo issued by the CRFB says that “the $64 billion on ACA subsidies alone would be more than enough to counter net tax increases below $400,000 in the JCT study,” while the bill also reduces “prescription drug costs for individuals (premiums and out of pocket) by roughly $300 billion.”

Various think tanks are still crunching the numbers on the final version of the bill that emerged from the Senate over the weekend. Critchfield said Republicans asked the JCT to run an analysis that included the ACA subsidies and many energy credits. That analysis still found a net tax increase, though the ACA subsidies are extended only three years, so when they run out, it looks like a tax increase in the later years covered by the bill.

There’s another wrinkle. Bill Gale and John Buhl of the Tax Policy Center have noted that the JCT, in its analysis, does not make a distinction between “normal” and “supernormal” returns on investment. Normal is what is needed to be a successful business, while supernormal means excess profits, earned through “patents, special expertise, outsized influence in product or labor markets, or just simple luck.” The bill would impose a corporate minimum tax on companies with $1 billion or more in profits — which are more likely to have supernormal returns. That might mean the tax would be less likely to affect investment or hiring than the JCT estimate assumes.

The Bottom Line

There is no easy way to adjudicate this debate. By the standards set by the Biden campaign in 2020, the president appears to have kept his promise not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year. Even Republicans concede that tax rates have not changed.

Advertisement

But the JCT is also the gold standard for analyzing the impact of tax policies — and few economists would dispute that higher corporate taxes work their way into the economy and eventually may affect hiring and investment.

What’s also difficult to measure is the combined impact of the various incentives contained in the bill and whether they basically wipe out the estimated impact of the corporate tax increases — which for most income groups is not very large.

She arrived every single time like an angel, at first from Down Under, an alluring variety-show distraction in the 1970s for our eagerly receptive, open-collared dads, who tuned out us kids by turning up the volume whenever “Have You Never Been Mellow” came on. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Everyone loved a little Olivia Newton-John, even our moms. The singer and actress, who died Monday at 73, had this unthreatening, sustaining beauty: the soft-focus treatment, the pearly whites, the big blue eyes, the voice that could be surprisingly strong even when it was whispery and ethereal. If the station wagon only got AM radio stations, something about her still came through crystal-clear. She was sunny beaches and dewy meadows and warm fireplaces.

And then: Just as the leading edge of Generation X felt the first thrilling tugs of something sexual, Newton-John went Hollywood.

Advertisement

In 1978’s “Grease,” she starred as the virginal Sandy Olsson, the new girl at Rydell High School circa 1959, taunted by the in-crowd for her shyness and prim apparel. The filmmakers had rewritten Sandy as an exchange student to accommodate the British-Australian accent no one would ever dream of disguising.

It didn’t matter that Newton-John was pushing 30 at the time; everyone in “Grease” was far too old to be playing a high school student, and what exactly was “Grease” supposed to be anyhow, besides an underwhelming act of musical theater? Was it an early case of nostalgia disorder, the final throes of a ’70s fixation with the ’50s? Was “Grease” intended as a farce meant to delight people old enough to appreciate a rough facsimile of American high school life before the Vietnam War era? Or was it just an excuse to pair Newton-John and the ruling heartthrob of the moment, John Travolta (as Danny Zuko), with just enough of a movie around them to send a double-album soundtrack to the Top 40 stratosphere?

“Grease” was all those things and more, I suppose, depending on the viewer at the time. If, however, you were anywhere from about 10 to 14 years old in 1978, it was mainly a glittery gymnasium all done up special for you — crepe streamers and big letters that spelled out P-U-B-E-R-T-Y. Down came the posters of Farrah Fawcett-Majors on her beach towel. Up went the posters of a transformed Sandy/Olivia, who finally wins Danny’s heart by adapting the ways of his trashy T-Bird and Pink Ladies ilk.

“Tell me about it, stud,” Sandy says, reintroducing herself after a stunning transformation (slutty, so many adults would remark at the time): big hair and skintight black pants, a tight, off-the-shoulder black top, red stiletto heels, flawless makeup. “I got chills!” Zuko’s Travolta thus proclaims, in their hit duet “You’re the One That I Want.”

Chills everywhere in the fifth grade, the sixth grade, up through the eighth grade. Libidos unleashed: Oh, well-uh, well-uh, well-uh, tell me more, tell me more! Name one girl at the slumber party who didn’t own the “Grease” soundtrack. Name one kid who didn’t get the allure, and perhaps even the metaphor, and some kind of provocation about adolescence: Warning, big changes ahead. Also: They’ll like you better if you glam it up a bit. And: Everyone in high school is having sex, so just be ready. Tell us more, tell us more. That was “Grease” when we first met it, and there was Newton-John in the middle of it, perhaps reckoning with this new grip she had on the preteen psyche, or perhaps not.

And then, a couple years later, the depths and miseries of middle school: Newton-John is an angel once more, this time arriving on roller skates, the muse Terpsichore (a.k.a. Kira) in the objectively terrible musical comedy “Xanadu,” which was released in the summer of 1980 during a tricky segue in the story of Gen X’s upbringing.

“Xanadu” came out a year before MTV and a year after all those racists and homophobes rioted at Comiskey Park while destroying heaps of records at a Disco Demolition Night (aimed squarely at Black artists, but also the work of the Bee Gees and, look closer, Newton-John). It came out amid the waning antiperspirant fumes of our Saturdays spent at America’s roller rinks. Newton-John offered protection in the form of supernatural, lushly overproduced pop: “Come take my hand,” she sings in the hit song “Magic.” “You should know me — I’ve always been in your mind.”

I remember that I didn’t want roller disco to end. I treasured those Saturdays, looping round and round the rink in my zippered tracksuit top, a giant yellow comb handle sticking out of my back pocket, reaching for just some of that magic. Yet I also knew it was too late. Everyone had followed Travolta instead, to “Urban Cowboy” and line-dancing around mechanical bulls.

And then, Newton-John made the savvier move, with an inescapable hit song called “Physical” and a new look aimed squarely at the nascent MTV age: fitness goddess of the 1980s. Leg warmers and spandex and a short haircut somewhere between Pat Benatar and Princess Di. No one fell harder for this iteration than our eighth-grade P.E. teacher, Mrs. Rapp, and this time that gymnasium was tricked out in exercise stations — dumbbells, pull-up bars, floor mats. Let’s get physical, people. Over and over it played, for weeks of P.E. class, while we worked out and ran laps.

You can hear “Physical” a hundred times, maybe a thousand, before you really hear what it’s about, and it’s not exercise. It’s a woman taking control of seduction, claiming for herself the tactics usually deployed by men: the flirtation, the dinner, the movie, the horny insistence. “There’s nothing left to talk about, ’less it’s horizontally.” Although Newton-John would not survive a coming onslaught of the far more suggestive pop hits of Prince and Madonna and beyond, she showed us a door to a kind of forbidden zone, if you chose to go through it, and naturally, we did.

For her, the trip was already ending. Life would lead her back to more beaches, seashells, those warm and mellow meadows. Sandy chose softness after all.

Olivia Newton-John, the dulcet-voiced singer from Australia who became a country-pop, folk-pop, rock-pop, disco-pop sensation in the 1970s, starred in the Hollywood musical juggernaut “Grease” and underwent a sultry makeover with her mega-selling 1981 record “Physical,” died Aug. 8 at her ranch in Southern California. She was 73. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Her family announced her death in a statement on Facebook, noting that she “has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.” Additional details were not immediately available, but for many years she owned a 12-acre estate on the Santa Ynez River near Santa Barbara.

Ms. Newton-John was treated for breast cancer in 1992, and she announced 25 years later, in 2017, that it had returned and metastasized. (She subsequently revealed that she had been battling the disease in private since 2013.)

Since her initial diagnosis at 44, Ms. Newton-John had become an advocate for cancer research and awareness, as well as for environmental causes. She sang for presidents and a pope, the sick and the disabled, and promoted music as a form of spiritual therapy, raising millions of dollars to fund the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Center at Melbourne’s Austin Hospital. Her later albums featured inspirational music about love, friendship and overcoming trauma.

“Music always helped me in my healing, and now it is my hope that it inspires healing in others,” she told a reporter in 2007.

Ms. Newton-John had burst forth in the mid-1960s as a perky teen singing talent on Melbourne TV shows and had a runaway hit in England with her 1971 solo cover of Bob Dylan’s “If Not for You.”

But her slickly produced, sugary-sweet mix of styles irritated purists of all stripes and left some reviewers searching for pejoratives. One compared her thin, nondescript voice to a sandwich loaf (“If white bread could sing . . . ”). A Playboy writer observed that her music made the listener “feel as if you’ve been wrapped in cotton candy and set out in the sun.”

When the Country Music Association named Ms. Newton-John its female vocalist of the year in 1974, Nashville stars including Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton formed a short-lived rival organization intended to exclude pop singers from their musical terrain. Some detractors spread the perhaps apocryphal story that Ms. Newton-John, on a visit to the country music capital, was excited to meet Hank Williams, the country legend who had been in his grave for 20 years.

Ms. Newton-John was widely considered one of the most guileless performers in the business and avoided responding to criticism in kind. “I was just a performer the audience found pleasant,” she told the Detroit Free Press. “And after all, the audience’s opinion is the only one that counts, isn’t it?”

Her revenge was at the cash register, with a string of hit songs. In her sold-out concert hall appearances, she tamped down expectations with self-deprecating wit, once telling an audience in Las Vegas: “About every 10 years, a really fantastic song comes along. And until it does, I’d like to sing one of mine.”

Advertisement

Then came “Grease” (1978), which showcased both her charm and sex appeal. The film, based on the long-running Broadway musical comedy about a 1950s high school, featured Ms. Newton-John as a goody-goody exchange student and cheerleader, Sandy, who falls for John Travolta as the (not so) bad-boy gang leader Danny.

By the finale, he is sporting a varsity letterman sweater, and she has transformed into a temptress wearing skintight black pants, a black biker’s jacket and red stilettos. She became an instant pinup for a generation of boys. “Those pants changed my life,” she quipped.

New York Times film critic Vincent Canby called Ms. Newton-John’s performance “very funny and utterly charming.” Audiences responded in particular to her chemistry with Travolta in duets such as “Summer Nights” and “You’re the One That I Want.” The soundtrack sold millions of copies and sent audiences back into the theater, creating a perfect commercial storm.

She squandered her stardom in “Xanadu” (1980), a musical roller-disco fantasy that also featured Gene Kelly and the Electric Light Orchestra. It gave her the chart-topping “Magic” but was otherwise a critical and box office fiasco, which she compounded with the bomb “Two of a Kind” (1983), co-starring Travolta.

Advertisement

All along, she searched for an image to sustain her musical career. She was the blue-eyed girl next door who delivered her words in a smoky whisper. Then she was the shoulder-shaking discotheque queen, with her blond hair shaped into foxy flip wigs. There was an unfortunate attempt to vixenize her with a bare back and a riding crop — courtesy of the kinky photographer Helmut Newton — on the cover of the 1985 album “Soul Kiss.”

The image was jarringly out of character for Ms. Newton-John, who said she was far more conservative, even “boring,” in her personal life. She worried that “Physical,” an aggressively suggestive song initially intended for British singer Rod Stewart, risked a backlash from her fans. She opted before the record was released to first make a lighthearted video, set in a gym filled with out-of-shape men instead of in a boudoir.

It cannonballed to No. 1 for 10 weeks, becoming the biggest hit of her American career and a staple of many aerobics classes in the era of headbands and leggings.

Within a few years, her musical and movie trajectory had plateaued, but she remained a staple of glossy magazines, which chronicled her personal travails. She was a survivor of cancer; of the deaths of family and close friends from the disease; and of her daughter’s public battle with depression, anorexia and drug abuse.

She also endured the bankruptcy of her Aussie-themed boutique chain, Koala Blue. And she overcame at least one very hinky relationship, with a debt-ridden Hollywood cameraman who may have faked his own death.

Through her anguish, she maintained a musical career that increasingly became more New Age catharsis than pop. Those albums, all of which featured her as a tunesmith, included “Gaia: One Woman’s Journey” (1994), “Stronger Than Before” (2006) and “Liv On” (2016).

From singing star to cancer survivor

Olivia Newton-John was born in Cambridge, England, on Sept. 26, 1948. Her mother, the former Irene Born, was the daughter of the Nobel Prize-winning German-Jewish physicist Max Born, who had fled to England during Hitler’s rise.

Her father, Brinley Newton-John, was a German instructor at the University of Cambridge who relocated the family to Australia in the early 1950s when he became dean of a college in Melbourne. It was a musical home, with her father playing piano and her mother on cello. Olivia, the youngest of three siblings, sang.

After her parents’ divorce, she found profound comfort in music. She sang at her brother-in-law’s coffeehouse on weekends, then at local dances and parties, and finally on TV. By 17, she had quit high school to pursue show business in England.

In 1969, the music impresario Don Kirshner, who had manufactured the Monkees as an American answer to the Beatles, assembled a band called Toomorrow that he described as “an action-adventure group — James Bond with music,” with Ms. Newton-John among its members. An eponymous science-fiction movie designed to launch the group proved an abysmal failure.

Ms. Newton-John represented England in the Eurovision contest in 1974 and lost to Sweden’s Abba — a small stumble on her climb up the charts.

She had long relationships with guitarist Bruce Welch of the Shadows and her onetime manager Lee Kramer before marrying Matt Lattanzi, a “Xanadu” backup dancer, in 1984. The marriage collapsed in the early 1990s amid the strain of her cancer fight.

In 2005, her on-and-off boyfriend of nine years, cameraman Patrick McDermott, disappeared on an overnight chartered fishing expedition off San Pedro, Calif. A Coast Guard investigation concluded that he probably drowned. But McDermott’s troubled financial history fueled enduring speculation that he had staged his death and was living incognito in Mexico. (Ms. Newton-John was in Australia at the time of the incident and was reserved in her public statements, once calling the situation “heartbreaking.”)

In 2008, Ms. Newton-John married John “Amazon John” Easterling, an importer of South American herbs. In addition to her husband, survivors include a daughter, Chloe Lattanzi, with whom Ms. Newton-John recorded a dance-beat version of “Magic” in 2015; a sister; and a brother.

“It’s funny, but now I am known more for being a breast cancer survivor than for being a performer,” Ms. Newton-John said long into her initial recovery from the disease. “It makes me proud to be someone who can inspire and help people. Maybe that was supposed to be my job all along.”

Celebrities flocked to social media with personal anecdotes and photos to remember Olivia Newton-John, the Australian actress and pop singer who died Monday at 73. Best known for 1978’s “Grease,” as well as her robust musical career, Newton-John spent her later years advocating for cancer research. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Newton-John was first diagnosed and treated for breast cancer in 1992. She was in remission until 2013, when the disease returned, and years later announced it had metastasized to her spine. A family statement posted Monday afternoon to Newton-John’s Facebook page emphasized how open she was about her breast cancer journey. It described her as a “symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years.”

That very sentiment echoed across social media. John Travolta, who played Danny Zuko opposite Newton-John’s Sandy Olsson in “Grease,” shared a photo on Instagram in honor of his “dearest Olivia.”

“Your impact was incredible,” he wrote. “I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again. Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever! Your Danny, your John!”

Barbra Streisand, who once featured on Newton-John and Travolta’s Christmas album, posted an old photo to Instagram of herself alongside Newton-John and singer and record producer Lou Rawls.

“Too young to leave this world. May she RIP,” Streisand wrote in the caption, adding a tearful emoji.

Dionne Warwick tweeted, “Another angelic voice has been added to the Heavenly Choir,” noting that her “dear friend” was also “once of the nicest people I had the pleasure of recording and performing with.”

Singer-songwriter Richard Marx, a close friend of Newton-John’s who also collaborated with her on music, wrote on Twitter that she was “as kind and loving a person as there’s ever been.”

Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd described her as “a great Australian woman” and “great advocate for global cancer research.”

Fans and celebrities alike made note of the four-time Grammy winner’s status as a musical icon, particularly throughout the 1970s and ’80s.

“Hopelessly Devoted to YOU, Olivia Newton John. Rest In Peace, Queen. Thank you for the music,” late-night host Andy Cohen captioned an Instagram video of her performing the “Grease” hit.

Comedian Kathy Griffin, sharing a video clip of an outlandish afternoon tea she once shared with Newton-John, wrote on Twitter that the singer-actress “rolled with EVERYTHING.”

Director James Gunn and actor Daniel Dae Kim described her as their first crushes, while comedian Billy Eichner called her “one of my first pop obsessions.”

Writer and romance novelist Bolu Babalola tweeted that Newton-John was “so charming and so beautiful with this spark within a veneer of a girl-next-door. One of the first romance leads I felt affinity to.”

Actor George Takei, referencing Newton-John’s 1980 musical fantasy film, wrote on Twitter that she is “now in the great Xanadu beyond.”

14,Republicans have rigged our democracy to produce more abortion bans - The Washington Post,"Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Which state charts the future of abortion rights in post-Roe America: Kansas or Indiana? I want the answer to be Kansas, but I fear it’s Indiana. Kansas voters last week surprised America — maybe even surprised themselves — by roundly defeating a referendum that would have removed protection for abortion rights from the state constitution. Three days later, Indiana legislators enacted a near-total ban on abortion, becoming the first state since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in late June to pass an abortion restriction.

Partisan politics doesn’t explain the difference: Both states are bright red. In the 2020 election, Donald Trump won 56 percent of the vote in Kansas and 57 percent in Indiana. In both states, polling suggests that voters are about evenly split on the issue but oppose extreme abortion bans.

Advertisement

The important — and telling — difference is that Kansas involved a statewide referendum by the voters and turnout was huge while Indiana was a law passed by a legislature heavily gerrymandered to enhance Republicans’ partisan advantage. Consider: Republicans generally receive 56 percent of the statewide vote in Indiana, yet the state legislature is even more tilted toward the GOP, whose members hold 39 of 50 Senate seats and 71 of 100 seats in the House.

Follow Ruth Marcus 's opinions Follow Add

This kind of partisan gerrymandering isn’t unique to Indiana — it’s endemic, and it turns the notion of returning abortion rights to the states into a cruel joke. When the democratic process isn’t democratic — when, by manipulating district boundaries to their advantage, one party gets to choose its voters — democracy becomes an illusion.

We arrived at this perilous condition thanks in large part to the Supreme Court, which announced three years ago that federal courts would not intervene to police partisan gerrymandering. “Excessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust,” the court proclaimed in its 5-4 ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause in 2019. “But the fact that such gerrymandering is ‘incompatible with democratic principles’ … does not mean that the solution lies with the federal judiciary.”

Advertisement

So the very court that issued paeans to democracy in Dobbs — “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” proclaimed Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. — enabled the kind of manipulation that ensures “the people’s elected representatives” do not represent them at all. It’s a bit much to stomach conservative justices’ complaints that Roe “short-circuited the democratic process” when they enabled the subversion of the democratic process in Rucho. Nice work, justices.

Marc Thiessen counterpoint Unlike Biden, most Democratic voters want strict abortion limits For one chilling illustration of the impact of partisan gerrymandering and its intersection with abortion rights, see Jane Mayer’s recent New Yorker article, “State legislatures are torching democracy,” describing Ohio’s “transformation into a center of extremist legislation, not just on abortion but on such divisive issues as guns and transgender rights.” Ohio now prohibits abortion after six weeks, with no exception for rape or incest; its legislature is poised to tighten access further after the summer recess.

There are other reasons for my dismal prediction that Indiana, not Kansas, might be the bellwether. The Kansas referendum was predicated on a 2019 ruling by the state Supreme Court that the Kansas constitution protected the right to abortion. Don’t count on many state supreme courts to come up with — or stick with — similar rulings; state Supreme Court justices are elected in 38 states now, and those races are increasingly ideological. And a referendum to uphold the status quo, as was the situation in Kansas, might be more appealing to voters than one to change it.

Advertisement

And, of course, regional differences intensified by ideological sorting mean that some states, left to their own devices, will impose strict limits on abortion even in the absence of partisan gerrymandering. Mississippi’s going to Mississippi, gerrymander or no gerrymander. In about 10 states, according to an analysis of state-level polling data by political scientists Jake Grumbach and Christopher Warshaw, majorities oppose allowing abortion. No Kansas-style referendum is going to work there.

The real problem is elsewhere, about 16 states, where Grumbach and Warshaw found “big differences between what the people … want and the laws that their legislatures have adopted.” There — thanks to partisan redistricting — the views of the majority won’t matter.

So forgive me for doubting claims that antiabortion lawmakers, having achieved what they said they wished for, will end up retreating from the extremist positions they staked out on abortion. In this fairytale version, the U.S. abortion status quo will coalesce around something like European norms, with abortion available until around 15 weeks (if without European protections such as national health insurance and ample exceptions.)

Advertisement

In some states, such as Florida (which now has a 15-week limit) and Virginia (where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has proposed that rule), sure. But in other purplish states, the abortion laws will have a redder hue than the public desires.

That could change — eventually. “When such a large percentage of the public favors something even if the other party controls the government over the long term, they do tend to eventually do what the public wants,” Warshaw told me. But his long term is awfully long, perhaps 20 to 30 years, meaning a full generation or more of women without abortion rights in this rosier scenario.

In the short run, brace for Indiana. Politicians don’t have to fear public backlash when they have effectively insulated themselves from any voters but those in their base.

15,"With the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats are no longer in disarray - The Washington Post","Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Wait, what? All of a sudden, Democrats are no longer in disarray. Instead, they’re marching in tight formation and achieving major goals. It’s such an unfamiliar sensation that it’s almost hard to recognize when it’s happening. Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates ArrowRight Transformational legislation like the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) wasn’t possible, according to the hive-mind narrative that many in Washington followed as recently as a few weeks ago. President Biden’s ambitious agenda was supposedly dead in the water. Squabbling Democrats would limp into the midterm elections, the only question how badly they would lose.

Now, it’s a different story.

Final Senate passage on Sunday of the giant climate change, health-care and tax reform package continued a remarkable winning streak for Biden. When House Democrats send the bill to Biden’s desk for his signature, which they could do later this week, the party will have an answer when midterm voters ask the all-important question “What have you done for me lately?”

Advertisement

The IRA, with its unintentional echo of the tax-deferred savings plans with the same initials, is the biggest investment this nation has ever made in fighting climate change. It will lower the cost of prescription drugs, especially for seniors. It will force some of our biggest and richest companies to pay at least some money in taxes. And it will significantly reduce, not add to, the federal budget deficit.

Follow Eugene Robinson 's opinions Follow Add

The bill including these sensible and popular measures passed the Senate without a single Republican vote. In an ugly footnote to the debate, Republicans temporarily blocked an unrelated, bipartisan measure ensuring adequate care for veterans sickened by fumes from toxic burn pits. Democrats and comedian Jon Stewart shamed GOP senators, saying they were pitching a fit about the IRA; Republicans said their objections were rooted in an accounting issue.

The result: It’s the Republican Party that now looks disorganized and dangerously out of step.

Advertisement

Take last week’s political earthquake in Kansas, a GOP stronghold, where voters massively rejected a measure that would have stripped protection for abortion rights out of the state constitution. In states across the country, most recently Indiana, Republican legislators are proposing or enacting draconian abortion bans with few or no exceptions — dragging the whole party over to what is clearly the wrong side of an urgent, hot-button issue that brings supporters of abortion rights to the polls in droves.

And rather than offering fresh policy proposals to make up for this attempt to force-march American women into the distant past, the party is playing the same old stale hits. Many GOP officials spent the past few days in Dallas attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, where Donald Trump falsely claimed once again that the 2020 election was “rigged and stolen,” called for a purge of the U.S. civil service, threatened social media companies and proposed sending the military into cities such as San Francisco, Chicago and New York to “restore order.”

For those who might have soured on Trump, CPAC’s alternative was Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a neofascist authoritarian. When Orban declared recently that Europeans should not “become peoples of mixed race,” a longtime adviser resigned and declared the remark “worthy of Goebbels.” CPAC’s response, delivered by organizer Matt Schlapp, was “Let’s listen to the man speak.” Orban was a headliner at the conference, railing that “the globalists can go to hell.” This is how the party wants to spend its time? Now throw in the wacky and incompetent Trump-endorsed candidates the party has nominated in key Senate races, and it’s the GOP looking like the party of bad, accidental comedy.

Before the summer, I’d have said there was no way Democrats could defy history and keep, much less grow, their slim majorities in the House and the Senate this fall. Now, I’d say that Democrats have a better-than-even chance of retaining control of the Senate — and at least a prayer of doing so in the House.

For Biden and his party, it helps that gasoline prices are falling about as rapidly as they rose. On June 14, the national average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $5.02, according to the American Automobile Association. On Monday, the average was $4.06 — and drivers are noticing the difference. And while we’ve had two successive quarters of slight economic contraction, this certainly doesn’t feel like a recession, not with unemployment at just 3.5 percent.

Overall inflation remains high, however, and there is not much that any president can do to bring prices down quickly. But it helps, politically, if a president and his party are visibly trying. So yes, there was good reason to call the historic legislation passed Sunday the IRA. Whether it will also prove to be the DRA — the Democratic Retention Act — remains to be seen.

16,Opinion | Liz Cheney is the Obi-Wan to Trump’s Darth Vader,"Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Star Wars fans, remember that scene in “Episode IV: A New Hope” when Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Sith lord Darth Vader are light-sabering it out on the Death Star? Kenobi and Vader are monologuing over the crackle of their clashing weapons when Kenobi declares, “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.” Then, in an act of self-sacrifice he hopes will hasten the destruction of the evil Empire, Kenobi allows Vader to do just that.

A version of this battle is playing out in real life with Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as Kenobi and former president Donald Trump as Vader. Now, I realize that Cheney’s father, former vice president Dick Cheney, has traditionally been known as Darth Vader, what with the Iraq War and “enhanced interrogation” techniques and all that. But work with me, people.

Ever since Trump summoned a mob to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Liz Cheney has made it her mission to destroy him. Well, by “destroy,” I mean hold him accountable for his violation of the Constitution and his oath to protect it — and ensure he never holds the high office ever again.

Advertisement

As the vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, Cheney has been merciless in that endeavor. Her remarks at the beginning and the end of each of the eight public hearings were a warning to the nation and a clarion call to her fellow Republicans about the danger to the republic that Trump remains.

Follow Jonathan Capehart 's opinions Follow Add

And like any power-mad wannabe despot, Trump has targeted Cheney for political elimination. Not satisfied by her removal from Republican House leadership, Trump endorsed her GOP primary challenger, who leads her by a whopping 22 points. There you have Trump’s Vader-like striking down; that the official vanquishing won’t occur until Wyoming’s Aug. 16 primary doesn’t much matter.

But follow the analogy a little further: Cheney’s presumptive defeat won’t be the end of the story. As with Obi-Wan, it will make her more powerful than Trump and his enablers can possibly imagine. Thanks to her fearlessness against Trump in defense of the Constitution, the congresswoman from Wyoming’s lone district now has a national stature independent of her famous last name. And that has led to the inevitable and growing chatter that Cheney should run for president, which will only intensify once she is in all likelihood politically martyred.

Advertisement

When asked during a CNN interview this past week about the desire to run for president, Cheney insisted that her focus is on her primary. But, when asked about the possibility of Trump capturing the Republican nomination again, Cheney sounded like someone lacing up for the next fight. “He cannot be our nominee, and he certainly cannot ever be elected president again,” Cheney said. “I intend to be a big part of making sure that we protect the nation from the threat that he poses.”

After Obi-Wan died, he didn’t come back to beat Vader himself. Cheney, should she run, wouldn’t stand much of a chance of beating Trump. But the old Jedi rejoined the mystical Force, and it’s his energy that helped turn the tide of the war ravaging the galaxy. As a Force ghost, he also guided other opponents of the Empire in their resistance. Could Cheney do the same?

Right now, I can’t think of another Republican with the guts and ferocity to do a better job of challenging Trump (or the dime-store substitutes putting a smiley face on Trumpism). You hear names such as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan or former New Jersey governor Chris Christie as possible entrants, but the former pales in comparison to Cheney and the latter is compromised by his work for Trump.

Advertisement

I never thought I’d say this, but I long for the days of the Republican Party that Cheney represents. The old-school GOP that championed limited government, fiscal restraint, and the defense of the ideals of democracy at home and abroad was far from perfect; the party’s social conservatism excluded millions of Americans who didn’t fit its cramped views of society. But even though the Cheney Republicans flirted with the fringe, they kept it at bay. Trump ushered the fringe into the mainstream.

Many of the former president’s acolytes have won primary races for various offices across the country that put them one election away from gaining real power to undermine the rule of law and fully destroy American democracy. These victories highlight Cheney’s immediate political peril, but they also reveal the urgency of her overall mission to stop Trump.

“If defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat,” Cheney said in that CNN interview, “then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make.”

The Force is strong with this one.

17,The Supreme Court was right to rely on history in the abortion and gun rulings - The Washington Post,"Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

William Baude is a law professor at the University of Chicago. The Supreme Court’s seismic term was notable not only for the decisions it reached but also how it reached them: making extensive use of history. This might seem like a bad development — turning back the clock on societal progress and calling for judges to do hackish, “law-office history.” But it is not. The question going forward is not whether the court should use history but how.

The court finds itself using history for both legal and practical reasons. History is inextricably connected to law. Our Constitution and statutes were enacted in the past, and amended in the past, and so understanding their content is an inherently historical endeavor. History, practiced properly, also can supply objectivity, giving the justices a basis for deciding beyond their personal views and the controversies of the day.

Advertisement

These uses of history, ironically, provide support for powerful legal change. If the court is to overturn nearly 50 years of precedent, as it did in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, it points to something even older and more deeply rooted than Roe v. Wade itself — the history and tradition surrounding the Constitution. So, too, if the court is to second-guess the gun-control legislation of modern jurisdictions, as it did in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, it does so by pointing to the Constitution’s text and history.

The use of constitutional history has been challenged as inherently regressive. Why should today’s public policy decisions owe anything to past eras when women or people of color were excluded from power? This argument misses the point. In cases like Dobbs, the court seeks to free government from constitutional constraint, arguing that today’s governing majorities are entitled to make their own choices about abortion policy, no matter what dead White men in wigs may have thought. In cases like Bruen, the court relies on historical arguments that the right to keep and bear arms was especially vital to newly freed African Americans in the wake of the Civil War. And in other cases, the court has used history to vindicate the rights of criminal defendants and other unpopular groups.

Another critique is that judges cannot do history well, and that their judgments will inevitably be results-oriented. The justices went to law school, not graduate programs in history, and only a few of their law clerks have such training. Historians frequently condemn the court’s historical claims as oversimplified, overconfident and twisted to reach the desired outcome. This, too, misses the point. What the Supreme Court is ultimately deciding is law, not history for its own sake. It turns to the historical record to better understand the text that it is entrusted with interpreting, and uses legal procedures to do it — a traditional performance of the craft of judging.

Advertisement

That the court is doing law, not just history, also responds to accusations that the court is inconsistent in which historical periods it emphasizes. The ultimate question is what our most fundamental law provides, which means focusing primarily on the periods when the Constitution was written and amended, and only secondarily on subsequent interpretations. The court is not trying to provide a broader history of our society’s attitudes toward guns, sex or anything else. Indeed, that is not its role.

The real issue is not whether the court should be using history but whether there are legally relevant pieces of history that it is missing. There is reason to worry about that in both Dobbs and Bruen. In Dobbs, the court makes it hard to recognize rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. But another clause of the Constitution, which the court relegates to a footnote, protects the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” against state abridgment. History suggests that these privileges or immunities include unenumerated rights of citizens, maybe even rights that are recognized over time. If so, Dobbs’s analysis is incomplete.

Meanwhile, in Bruen, the court refused to allow any kind of “interest balancing” of gun rights against public safety. But deeper historical research might support such balancing after all. At the Founding and during Reconstruction, many constitutional rights were subject to regulation in the name of the public good. Such arguments could support more regulation of Second Amendment rights than the court suggests.

Advertisement

These historical problems do not necessarily mean that Dobbs or Bruen reached the wrong result. But they could make a big difference to the scope of those decisions in coming decades.

This brings us to the broader lesson. In recent years, many critics of the court — including some dissenting justices — have ceded the initiative. They have tried to shield themselves behind precedents or to poke holes in the majority’s arguments without advancing a competing constitutional theory.

That is true even of recent dissents that engaged superficially on historical grounds. That will not be enough. The court’s increasing reliance on history creates an opportunity for those critics to provide their own rigorous account of our law and constitutional tradition. To seize that opportunity, they will have to make the best use of history, not try to escape it.

18,Opinion | There should be no impunity for Russia’s slaughter of POWs,"Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

It has been more than a week since an explosion and fire tore through a prison barracks in Russian-held Ukraine, killing at least 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war and injuring dozens more. This horrific event on July 29 led immediately to dueling accusations as Ukraine and Russia blamed each other. With each passing day, however, evidence — direct and circumstantial — mounts that this was, indeed, a premeditated massacre by Russia. As such, it would rank as one of the worst war crimes yet, in a war marked by the atrocity with which Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops have waged it. There must be an investigation, followed by full accountability for the perpetrators, lest international law on treatment of prisoners of war become another casualty of Mr. Putin’s aggression.

Most of the soldiers held at the Olenivka prison site are members of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment who surrendered after fighting for weeks from a last redoubt in the city of Mariupol. Their status as ex-combatants entitles them to all the protections of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Arguably, the mere fact that Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists were holding them at Olenivka, just about 12 miles from the front line, violates the provision which reads: “Prisoners of war shall be evacuated, as soon as possible after their capture, to camps situated in an area far enough from the combat zone for them to be out of danger.” Thus, Russia and its allies would be at fault even if one believes their version of events: Ukraine targeted the prison with rocket fire from a U.S.-provided HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) system, supposedly to keep the POWs from disclosing secret information or Ukrainian war crimes.

Advertisement

And the Russian story is highly dubious: It does not explain how Ukraine’s army could know the Azov soldiers would have been in the particular building when they purportedly fired at it. Nor does it square with the analysis of experts, consulted by The Post, who noted that damage depicted in photos of the site is inconsistent with a rocket attack.

Far more plausible is Ukraine’s allegation that Russia targeted the POWs for annihilation, for two reasons: to take revenge on the Azov unit for waging ferocious resistance at Mariupol and to prevent POWs from reporting the torture to which they have been subjected at Olenivka, also in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Prisoners had been newly moved to the targeted barracks; satellite photos show fresh excavations on nearby grounds shortly before the explosion, as though those in charge were preparing mass graves. Within hours of the incident, the Russian Embassy in London tweeted a supposed quotation from purported Mariupol residents: “Azov militants deserve execution, but death not by firing squad but by hanging, because they’re not real soldiers. They deserve a humiliating death.”

Small wonder that the International Committee of the Red Cross, the neutral body that monitors compliance with the Geneva Conventions, has not had access to Olenivka since May 20, despite requesting a visit and offering aid immediately after news of the July 29 explosion broke. The secretary-general of the United Nations has announced a fact-finding mission. The truth must come out. Russia has already shredded key post-World War II rules against instigating aggressive war. It cannot be allowed to destroy restraints on the conduct of war, too.

19,Opinion | Germany is finally acting like Europe’s major power,"Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

American statesmen have long regarded Germany with frustration: They wanted Europe’s economic giant to stop being a political dwarf. Today, there is at least a chance that their wish will be granted. In a world of increasingly assertive autocracies, Germany’s potential transformation is a welcome prospect. There are three elements to watch.

The first sign of the new Germany involves defense. Over the past dozen years, German military spending has averaged around $40 billion annually, or a bit over 1 percent of gross domestic product. To put that in perspective, in 2021 the U.S. defense budget was about 14 times bigger. But three days after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that his country would henceforth exceed the NATO military spending target of 2 percent of GDP — and that it would do so “year after year.” As a down payment, Scholz committed $107 billion to upgrading Germany’s military capacity, a sum almost equivalent to the annual defense expenditures of Japan and France combined.

Scholz is a workhorse, not a show horse, and he could have delivered faster. But five months into the war, Germany published a detailed list of its arms shipments to Ukraine: some 3,000 antitank weapons, 3,200 portable air-defense systems and much more. Meanwhile, Germany has announced additional deliveries, including 100 howitzers and 16 bridge-layer tanks. Despite the pacifist roots of his Social Democratic Party and his Green coalition partner, the chancellor is making good on his promise to turn Germany into Europe’s leading military power.

Advertisement

Then there is Germany’s energy U-turn. In 2011, when a tsunami hit Japan’s nuclear facilities in Fukushima, the government of then-Chancellor Angela Merkel experienced the policy equivalent of a breakdown. Merkel immediately decommissioned about half of Germany’s nuclear generation capacity and declared that the rest would be shuttered by December 2022. In 2017, Merkel’s government passed a law that more or less banned fracking, even though Germany had been safely using this technique for years to exploit its considerable natural gas reserves.

The outcome has been a dangerous dependence on gas imports from Russia, which accounted for 55 percent of German gas consumption on the eve of the Ukraine invasion. A long Cold War tradition of “Ostpolitik” — the policy of softening the Communist East by trading with it — made this folly feel acceptable. But Russia’s assault on Ukraine served as a wake-up call. For the past five months, Scholz has been scrambling to develop alternative energy sources. Russian gas now represents just 27 percent of German consumption. Scholz has begun talking about extending the life of Germany’s three remaining nuclear plants.

Germany’s third transformation relates to its neighbors. A decade ago, Berlin’s rigidity during the euro crisis exasperated the Obama administration, which wanted a stable commercial and geopolitical partner in Europe. Germany fanned populism in the weaker Southern European economies by forcing too much austerity on them. It sniped at the European Central Bank’s efforts to assist them with monetary easing. It rejected the idea of common European bonds, closing off another channel of crisis-fighting aid. It refused even to invest adequately in its own economy, depriving German industry of digital infrastructure and the rest of Europe of a useful fillip to demand.

Today, Germany is thinking differently. As part of its response to the covid-19 pandemic, Berlin approved more than $800 billion worth of jointly guaranteed euro-zone bonds. Meanwhile, confronted by the latest financial tremors on Europe’s periphery, this time in too-big-to-fail Italy, Germany has gone along with a prompt ECB pledge to backstop the debt of governments that get into trouble. And domestic austerity has gone out the window. Germany’s budget deficit stands at 3.7 percent of GDP, a big shift from the consistent surpluses before the covid pandemic.

Of course, Germany has stirred before — and then fallen asleep again. In 1999, it summoned the fortitude to back a military response to ethnic cleansing in Kosovo; over the next decade, however, its defense spending actually fell. But today’s German awakening is less about a war of choice and more about self-preservation. Russia has proved itself to be far more dangerous than the Germans had imagined. Thanks to the once and possibly future presidency of Donald Trump, the United States has shown itself to be a far less reliable ally. China, shaking its fist at Taiwan, looks like an increasingly poor candidate to be Germany’s main trading partner, though that is what it has become.

Scholz has recognized these shifts and is responding, demonstrating the value of a leader with a plodding, empirical style. People in the former East Germany are nervous about antagonizing Russia, but a majority of the country backs the chancellor’s stand. So do Scholz’s fellow Social Democrats. As Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the party, put it recently, “Germany must lay claim to be a leading power.”

20,Opinion | How Filipino Americans could decide the balance of the Senate,"Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

ENTERPRISE, Nev. — There’s been a lot of talk about how Hispanics’ shift to the right could empower Republicans. But another ethnic group might also be crucial to deciding Senate control: Filipino Americans. Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates ArrowRight The demographic rarely gets the attention it deserves in terms of the increasing influence of Asian Americans in politics. In fact, it is one of the largest immigrant groups in the United States. More than 4 million Filipinos live in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. That’s about 18 percent of all Asian Americans and the third largest Asian ethnic group behind Chinese and Indians.

Filipinos are especially numerous in the key swing state of Nevada. They comprise about half of the state’s Asian population, which cast 5 percent of the votes in the 2020 elections. Asians make up a larger share of the population in Las Vegas and its prosperous suburbs. They’re nearly 11 percent of Clark County, the county that houses the Vegas metro area, and 21 percent of the highly contested 3rd Congressional District. Quick math shows that Filipinos are between 5 percent and 10 percent of the adult population here, more than enough to tip a close election.

This group’s demographics and political history give hope to both parties. Working in Democrats’ favor are their relative education and wealth. Filipinos in the United States are highly educated, with nearly half holding a bachelor’s or postgraduate degree. They are also affluent, with a median annual household income of $90,400. White people with similar demographics have been swinging toward Democrats in recent years.

But the socio-religious background of many Filipino Americans gives Republicans hope. Filipinos are overwhelmingly Catholic, meaning they are relatively socially conservative. A 2012 Pew survey found that half of Filipino Americans believe that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, a much higher share than among the nation as a whole. Filipino Americans are therefore likely to support the overturning of Roe v. Wade at much higher levels than White college-educated voters, making Democrats’ embrace of legal abortion problematic with this demographic.

This background is probably a reason Filipino Americans are more Republican than most other Asian groups. A September 2020 poll found that 28 percent identified as Republicans and 34 percent were planning to vote for President Donald Trump, second only to Vietnamese Americans among all major Asian ethnicities. This gives the GOP a stronger base on which to build.

Republicans in Nevada are trying to do that through targeted outreach and general messaging. GOP Senate nominee Adam Laxalt recently attended the National Federation of Filipino American Associations annual meeting, held in Las Vegas, and also published an op-ed in the Asian Journal outlining why Asian American voters should shift to the GOP. The Republican National Committee has also opened an Asian American community center as part of that effort.

So far, the data is mixed about whether Filipino Americans are shifting rightward. A national July poll found Filipino Americans have not moved to the right since 2020. But an analysis of national Asian American data by CNN analyst Harry Enten found a significant shift to the GOP. A recent Nevada poll conducted by Emerson College showed nearly 51 percent of Asian Americans approved of President Biden’s performance and 61 percent supported Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. The sample size for Asians was only 122, though, giving it a substantially larger error margin than for the survey as a whole.

Republicans may have a secret weapon, however: Filipino American patriotism. The Philippines was an American colony between 1898 and 1946, and the United States liberated the islands from Japanese rule with substantial Filipino support during World War II. The United States has been viewed extremely favorably in the Philippines, even during Trump’s presidency. Simply put, many Filipinos love America. That could make problematic Democrats’ willingness to tolerate, or in some cases embrace, elements in their coalition that view U.S. history harshly.

Terry McAuliffe’s debate gaffes in his 2021 gubernatorial run in Virginia over parental influence in education significantly increased Asian support for Republican Glenn Youngkin. A similar gaffe on U.S. culture and history by a Nevada Democrat could have the same effect.

Nevada’s swing state status and its mélange of ethnic groups make it a petri dish for election analysis this year. Don’t be surprised if the often-overlooked Filipino American vote proves decisive.

21,Drug companies are warning that Medicare pricing reform spells doom. Don't fall for it. - The Washington Post,"Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Avik Roy is president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP) and a former policy adviser to Mitt Romney, Rick Perry and Marco Rubio. Gregg Girvan is a resident fellow at FREOPP. Democrats are on the verge of passing legislation that, among other things, would empower the government to directly negotiate the price Medicare pays for a handful of the costliest prescription drugs. The measure has precipitated hyperbole from industry lobbyists, who say it represents an existential threat to medical innovation. One prominent group recently claimed the bill “could propel us light years back into the dark ages of biomedical research.”

The only problem? It’s not true. Not all drugmaker revenues are created equal, and not all pharmaceutical research and development spending leads to equally innovative outcomes.

Advertisement

Forthcoming research from our think tank, the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, proves what investors have long known: The R&D labs of the global pharma giants are lumbering and inefficient.

We analyzed pricing practices and R&D productivity for 17 of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, AbbVie, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson. Together, these companies represent more than 60 percent of global pharma revenue and 56 percent of industry R&D spending.

Reducing big-pharma spending likely wouldn’t have a large effect on drug development. Consider this: Had the largest companies held net prices constant on a single large drug in each of their portfolios from 2012 to 2021, Americans would have spent $139 billion less on prescription drugs. Because big companies deployed about 18 percent of their revenue on R&D, that $139 billion in savings translates to approximately $25 billion in reduced R&D spending by the majors.

Advertisement

But according to our analysis, that $25 billion in R&D spending accounts for only five drugs developed in these giants’ own labs. That’s 1.2 percent of the 430 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in that period.

In fact, the largest drug companies are only one-fifth as efficient as the overall industry in R&D. The big companies spend $5 billion per newly developed homegrown drug; the industry average is closer to $1 billion.

It’s not surprising that big drug companies are less innovative than their smaller brethren. Because small biotechs can offer their scientists stock options, the brightest and most creative drug developers prefer to work at start-ups, where, if successful, they can retire early.

Perversely, the Medicare program handsomely rewards large, low-innovation companies to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. That’s not how free markets are supposed to work.

Advertisement

In innovative industries governed by fair competition, prices go down as technology improves. But Medicare has not been such a market. Branded drugs enjoy monopoly status, on average, for the first decade after FDA approval, with some exclusivities lasting much longer. Medicare plans are forced by law to pay for many of these drugs, irrespective of their cost or benefit to patients. In Medicare Part B, doctors get a 6 percent commission on the price of drugs they prescribe, incentivizing them to give patients the costliest drug available and encouraging drug companies to increase their prices at every opportunity to attract more prescribers.

The Democrats’ bill would help repair these distortions. It carefully targets only 20 of the 4,100 drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and D, allowing the government to negotiate prices for those that are costliest to seniors and taxpayers.

It also protects the smaller companies where most innovation actually takes place. It exempts “orphan drugs” treating rare diseases; drugs that cost the Medicare program less than $200 million per year; drugs that represent 80 percent or more of a company’s sales to Medicare Part B or D; and drugs that represent no more than 1 percent of Medicare’s Part B or D pharmaceutical spending. The bill requires Medicare to focus its negotiations on drugs whose monopolies have lasted 12 years or longer — more than enough time for genuinely innovative companies to generate a return on their R&D investment.

Advertisement

We should absolutely continue to reward truly innovative drugmakers for medicines that benefit patients. But monopolists who raise prices on decades-old drugs are not contributing to innovation. They’re contributing to Medicare’s insolvency.

The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the bill’s Medicare drug reforms will reduce federal spending by nearly $200 billion from 2022 to 2031. And the CBO estimated that those savings could increase in future decades. Furthermore, when Medicare’s costs decrease, seniors benefit from lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs.

Unfortunately, Democrats have loaded up their reconciliation bill with a 15 percent minimum corporate income tax that would force younger, innovative biotech companies to spend less on R&D. And overall, the bill’s deficit reduction potential has been undermined by about $400 billion over a decade in new energy subsidies, and more than $300 billion in federal loan guarantees that may never be repaid.

Nevertheless, fiscal advocates have fought for years to improve Medicare’s sustainability. Medicare drug reform — as a standalone effort — could do just that.

Carolyn Hax is away. The following is from March 7 and 14, 2008. Dear Carolyn: I have three kids. I love them all. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But one of them is my delight. I don’t admit this to anyone, not even my husband. I try so hard not to favor her in any way. There are big age gaps between all three kids, so it’s reasonably easy to hide. Plus, I’m seriously motivated.

In all my courtside, backstage, poolside, deck-chair conversations with other moms, no one EVER talks about this, no matter how many margaritas have been swirled. Is this the dirty little secret of parenting? Or are most people really fair in their affections?

— Anonymous

Anonymous: I’m choosing against any answer that requires purity of “most people.”

I do think it’s common to feel and highly uncommon to express. Not because I have insight into a statistically significant sampling of parents, or specific firsthand knowledge (of course!), but because it makes too much sense.

Take the feelings people do express freely: We prefer one parent to another, one sibling to others, one grandparent, aunt, colleague, neighbor, dog, barista, TV character to others. Are you friends with a couple? Then you like one half better. The Earth is round, the sky is blue and some people fit better than others.

Follow the logic, and having equal feelings for multiple children would be the affront to nature, yet the reverse seems to earn that distinction.

It’s obvious why: Children are different. There are many reasons, but it’s mainly because there’s no greater power than a parent’s over a child. A good parent knows this, knows the weight of it, and wants to use it to uplift, not to crush. And how better to crush Sammie than to reveal her own mommy likes Pammie better?

So, you summon the same enthusiasm for their different strengths. Your kids will figure it out regardless, but it will matter that they never heard it from you.

Dear Carolyn: Will you please advise on the sensitive subject of speaking with the family of a close friend who killed himself? I learned of this tragedy two months later, when the man’s fiancee answered an email sent to him. (They both lived in Chicago; the fiancee’s parents, his parents, and I are in Ohio.) I didn’t know what to do, so I left a message of condolence when I called his parents. (Thank the deities for answering machines.) I’m uncertain how to behave. This is not an area where one is prepared to make discreet and sensitively written statements.

— D.R.

D.R.: The most pain doesn’t come from well-meaning but indiscreet words; it comes from silence.

This man was ill. He died. That his death was by his own hand doesn’t change those two essential facts. Please send notes to his parents and fiancee, saying how much you’ll miss your friend, how warmly you remember him and how sorry you are for their loss.

24,Wrap egg salad in nori for an umami-rich breakfast or snack,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

When I am looking for a quick breakfast or snack I regularly turn to what I call my mini egg salad. I routinely keep hard cooked eggs in the refrigerator, so I can make it for myself on a whim. I peel one egg, chop it up in a little bowl, stir in a dab each of mustard and mayo, and a sprinkle of salt and freshly ground pepper. Then I eat it right out of the same bowl scooping it onto, say, whole grain crackers or stalks of celery. If I am feeling adventurous, I might add fresh dill or hot sauce to the mix.

One day I decided to take it up a notch and layer my single serving of egg salad into a sheet of sushi nori I had laying around. Taking cues from elements commonly found in Japanese hand rolls, I added matchsticks of cucumber and scallions, then topped it with a spray of microgreens and wrapped it up.

It was so tasty, I just had to share it with you here. I kept this recipe simple, so it would stay PB-and-J-easy, but you could run with it, adding a touch wasabi paste, a sprinkle of shichimi togarashi, and/or cooked, shelled edamame.

Advertisement

You could also substitute another raw vegetable for the cucumber based on what you have around, such as radish or red bell pepper, and you could use red or sweet white onion instead of the scallion.

The recipe here makes four servings in case you are feeding a group, or want to make a batch of the egg salad ahead and have the other ingredients prepped to be wrapped up into a hand roll on a moment’s notice. But you can always play it like I usually do, dividing the recipe by four, and making just one mini egg salad wrap at a time, to have all to yourself whenever you want one.

25,Limited monkeypox vaccine supply would be stretched under FDA plan,"Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Biden administration officials are set to announce Tuesday a new strategy to split monkeypox vaccine doses in hopes of vaccinating up to five times as many people against the virus, according to officials with direct knowledge of the plan. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The strategy, first described publicly by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf last week, would allow the Biden administration to stretch its limited supply of monkeypox vaccines by changing how those shots are administered. Rather than inject doses of Jynneos subcutaneously, a traditional way of delivering vaccines into the fatty tissue under the skin, the doses would instead be injected under the top layer of the skin. This approach, known as an intradermal injection, uses a thinner needle and less vaccine, but leads to a small bubble forming on the surface of the skin that can scar.

The change in injection method would maximize the immune reaction generated by the vaccine and allow U.S. officials to only administer one-fifth of the original dose, Califf told reporters last Thursday, stressing that the approach would not compromise safety or efficacy.

The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global health emergency on July 23. Here's what you need to know about how it spreads. (Video: Joy Yi, Fenit Nirappil/The Washington Post, Photo: CDC/The Washington Post)

“It really means, basically, sticking the needle within the skin and creating a little pocket there into which the vaccine goes,” Califf said, comparing it to tests for tuberculosis and other injections performed by health-care workers. “This is really nothing highly unusual.”

Advertisement

But the planned change in vaccine dosing would be a large-scale, real-time experiment as officials race to stave off a monkeypox outbreak that has infected more than 8,900 people in the United States. If successful, the new vaccine plan would allow the Biden administration to transform hundreds of thousands of existing doses of Jynneos — the only FDA-approved vaccine for monkeypox — into several million potential shots. Although U.S. officials last month received nearly 800,000 additional doses of Jynneos, demand has rapidly outpaced supply and more doses are not expected for weeks.

The change is not without risk. People who receive the pared-down version of the Jynneos vaccine, which is intended as a two-dose regimen, may end up needing additional shots if the new vaccine strategy leads to an insufficient level of protection against the virus. Local officials may also struggle to administer the new strategy, which could require additional training and supplies like new needles to safely deliver the shots.

“This isn’t a ‘snap your fingers and it’s done,’ ” said a public health expert who was briefed by the administration on its pending plan but was not authorized to comment. “There’s a lot of complexity to rolling this out right, many vaccination sites won’t be fully ready, and it’s not obvious that [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] has done everything it should to help get local preparations in place.”

Advertisement

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he had concerns about the immune protection provided by the strategy, particularly for people with health conditions like HIV. “We don’t yet have the data to know how effectively an intradermal-administered vaccination will protect immunocompromised persons,"" he said.

HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FDA said Monday that the agency did not have any information to share.

Administration officials worked through the weekend on the logistics of the new strategy, drawing on prior studies into splitting vaccine doses, which is often referred to as “dose-sparing.” Infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci and other senior administration officials have reviewed that data and support the planned change, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.

Advertisement

The federal government must still take several steps before the vaccine change is legally permissible. Although Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last Thursday declared monkeypox a public health emergency, he would need to issue a second declaration that would allow for “emergency use” of the existing monkeypox vaccines and other medical countermeasures, such as the plan to change how the shots are administered.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also working on guidance for health-care workers on how to administer the new vaccine strategy, according to two other people with knowledge of the planned announcement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.

Outside experts signaled their support for the idea. Daniel McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement that his organization “agrees with the strategy under consideration by FDA.”

Advertisement

The plan is “supported by compelling evidence of an equally strong immune response compared to the current strategy and could be an effective way to achieve the important goal of vaccinating more people,” McQuillen wrote.

But he noted that changing the way the shots would be administered could create new challenges, such as the greater risk of a skin reaction at the injection site. “For this strategy to succeed, strong public education about the way to correctly administer the vaccine intradermally and collection of data on its impacts will be essential.”

Scott Gottlieb, who served as commissioner of the FDA during the Trump administration, said officials were drawing on existing research into vaccines used for smallpox, a related virus.

“There’s a lot of data that FDA has looked at … [on] how we would extend doses of the smallpox vaccine. What they learned from those studies is transferrable to this vaccine for monkeypox,” Gottlieb said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

Advertisement

But Osterholm, who served as state epidemiologist in Minnesota, said his team regularly dealt with problems where seasoned public health workers struggled with administering the injections needed for tuberculosis testing.

“This is a well-recognized issue where intradermal injections can be tough to do, without adequate training,” he said.

The Biden administration has faced sustained criticism from patients, local public health officials and some lawmakers for not ordering more monkeypox vaccines earlier in the response, as demand now outpaces supply. Federal officials consider at least 1.6 million gay and bisexual men at highest risk for the virus and are urging them to get the shots.

26,The GOP blocked an insulin price cap: What it means for diabetics,"Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The Senate passed a sweeping budget package Sunday intended to bring financial relief to Americans, but not before Republican senators voted to strip a proposal that would have capped the price of insulin at $35 per month for many patients. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight A proposal that limits the monthly cost of insulin to $35 for Medicare patients was left untouched. But using a parliamentary rule, GOP lawmakers were able to jettison the part of the proposal that would apply to privately insured patients.

Seven Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the broader price cap, but that wasn’t enough for passage. A number of Republican senators who voted for the proposal to be removed come from states with some of the highest mortality rates for diabetes, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee.

Advertisement

Lowering the price of drugs such as insulin, which is used by diabetics to manage their blood sugar levels, is broadly popular with voters, polling shows. Senate Democrats denounced Republicans for voting against relief for Americans struggling to pay for the lifesaving drug.

More than 30 million Americans have diabetes, and about 7 million require insulin daily to manage their blood sugar levels.

Here’s what we know about how Americans would be affected by the Senate vote:

What would the insulin price cap do?

The insulin price cap, part of a larger package of proposals to cut prescription drug and other health-care costs, was intended to limit out-of-pocket monthly insulin costs to $35 for most Americans who use insulin.

More than 1 in 5 insulin users on private medical insurance pay more than $35 per month for the medicine, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The same analysis found that the median monthly savings for those people would range from $19 to $27, depending on their type of insurance market.

Advertisement

The average Medicare patient using insulin paid $54 for prescriptions, according to KFF, an increase of nearly 40 percent since 2007.

With the Republican vote to strip the provision, only Medicare recipients would be eligible for the cap. The legislation still must pass the House.

Why is insulin so expensive?

Insulin was discovered in Canada in the 1920s, and the researchers, who won the Nobel Prize, sold their patent to the University of Toronto for $3. Since then, the drug has become a major commercial enterprise.

The global insulin market is dominated by U.S.-based Eli Lilly, the French company Sanofi and the Danish firm Novo Nordisk. A report released in December by Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee accused the drugmakers of repeatedly raising their prices in lockstep and working to “maintain monopoly pricing,” allegations the companies have denied.

Advertisement

In a statement, Novo Nordisk said the complexities of the U.S. health-care system influence the insulin market and that “many factors” determine what a person pays out of pocket for insulin. The company said net prices for its products have “continued to decline over the past 5 consecutive years.” A Sanofi spokesperson said in a statement that “despite rhetoric about insulin prices,” the net price of its insulin has fallen for seven straight years, “making our insulins significantly less expensive for insurance companies.”

Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A generic insulin is slated to come on the market in 2024 and could help drive down prices.

Researchers also blame issues such as increasingly complicated supply chains for the dramatic rise in drug prices over the past decade. U.S. insulin prices are well above the average price paid in other developed countries, according to a government report.

Advertisement

A Yale University study found insulin is an “extreme financial burden” for more than 14 percent of Americans who use it. These people are spending more than 40 percent of their income after food and housing costs on the medicine.

What does this mean for uninsured patients and Medicaid recipients?

The legislation doesn’t limit the cost of insulin for uninsured patients, despite last-minute lobbying from some House lawmakers to add in such protections. Uninsured Americans with diabetes are more likely to be using less costly formulations of insulin compared with those on private insurance or Medicaid, yet they have a higher tendency to pay full price for the lifesaving medication, according to a 2020 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a health-care think tank.

For those on Medicaid, many don’t have co-pays for insulin, though some states may have modest amounts beneficiaries must pay, such as $2 for a standard prescription, according to Sherry Glied, dean of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University.

Advertisement

But in general, costs for those with diabetes can vary widely from person to person, except for those on Medicaid.

“There’s no average person with diabetes, right, and so no two people are managing their diabetes in the exact same way,” said Aaron Turner-Phifer, advocacy director for JDRF, an organization funding research into Type 1 diabetes. “Folks are taking different types of insulin, they’re taking them via pens, they’re taking them via pumps, some are using different devices. … The amount of insulin that they’re taking varies from person to person”

What are Republicans saying about the insulin price cap?

Many Republicans have opposed the $35 cap, saying the measure did not address the root problem of skyrocketing insulin prices. Instead, they said, it would force insurance companies to pass on the cost through premiums.

Advertisement

The cap would have also been a major win for Democrats ahead of the midterm elections in November, possibly feeding GOP opposition to the proposal.

Still, other Republicans decried what they have called “socialist” government interference in the free market. “Today it’s the government fixing the price on insulin,” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “What’s next, gas? Food?”

Did President Donald Trump lower the price of insulin?

In 2020, President Donald Trump claimed that he had drastically lowered the price of insulin: “Insulin, it’s going to — it was destroying families, destroying people. The cost,” Trump said in a debate. “I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water.” His statement drew criticism from patient advocates and people still struggling to afford their medication.

Advertisement

In 2020, drugmakers reduced the cost of insulin for some patients who lost jobs, health insurance or both as a result of the pandemic.

Trump signed an executive order to lower the price of insulin as one of his final health-care acts in office. The ruling was narrow, experts said, and would have lowered the cost of insulin for certain patients who go to certain federally qualified health centers.

It was rescinded by the Biden administration. Health officials said at the time that the rule would have imposed “excessive administrative costs and burdens” on health centers — and reduced resources for other health services.

Where have Democrats and Republicans stood historically on insulin prices?

Both Democrats and Republicans have blasted the high price of insulin, including in congressional hearings and in bipartisan investigations. But they’ve taken different approaches toward curbing the cost of the medicine.

Advertisement

Republicans have long proposed alternatives to Democrats’ drug-pricing measures. In the House, key GOP lawmakers have released plans to place a monthly $50 cap on insulin and its supplies for those in Medicare’s drug benefit after seniors hit their deductibles. In the Senate, top-ranking Republicans have crafted a bill to make permanent an existing temporary pilot project that gives those on Medicare the option to get a voluntary prescription drug plan where insulin costs $35 per month.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan pair of senators unveiled legislation in June aimed at tackling the cost of insulin, which was the result of months of work to forge a compromise. But the legislation hasn’t come up for a vote and faces daunting political odds in its quest to obtain 10 Republican votes to pass the bill in the Senate.

Evan Halper, Bryan Pietsch and Tony Romm contributed to this report.

HOMESTEAD, Fla. — In the nearly two decades she has worked in South Florida’s plant nurseries, baking under greenhouse plastic covers, Sandra Ascencio has seen more than her share of misery. Ascencio remembers seeing the body of a co-worker several years ago crumpled in the parking lot as paramedics tried to revive her. The woman struggled with asthma in hot weather and may have been trying to reach her air-conditioned car, Ascencio said.

In 2008, Ascencio collapsed while working at a different nursery. She said she suffered heatstroke, lost consciousness and spent a week in the hospital.

Today, she belongs to a growing group of immigrant laborers in South Florida pushing for what many health experts say is the best way to prevent heatstroke as temperatures reach new extremes: a law requiring employers to provide outdoor workers with drinking water, shade and rest breaks on hot days.

But as the need to keep workers safe from heat grows, many efforts to do so have failed. While places like California and Washington have adopted workplace rules to address heat exposure, many other states’ attempts to mandate these protections have been blocked or weakened following opposition from industry groups representing agriculture, construction and other business interests, according to public records and those involved in efforts to craft new rules. The Biden administration’s plan to draft heat rules for workers is likely to face similar resistance and legal challenges from the biggest companies.

In Nevada, where climate change is fueling hotter summers, state data shows workplace heat stress complaints nearly tripled from 2016 to 2021. But a heat safety regulation adopted by the state’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration is awaiting final approval from a panel of lawmakers, who have put off a vote for months. Victoria Carreon, an administrator at the Nevada Department of Business and Industry, said the agency is in talks with industry groups “concerned about the burdens on businesses of having to implement regulations.”

In hot and humid Virginia, the state’s workplace safety board voted against a proposal to adopt a heat illness prevention rule last year. At the time, its members were appointed by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat. And workplace heat bills introduced in New York and Maine have been unsuccessful.

“A lot of states have been getting a tremendous amount of pushback,” said Juley Fulcher, a worker health advocate for the nonprofit Public Citizen, which has pushed for a national heat standard requiring employers to give workers water, shade and rest breaks. “There is this generic response you hear from business groups: ‘We’re taking care of it.’ Others say it just needs to be really flexible — almost so flexible that it’s not a rule.”

A heat illness prevention bill has failed three times in Florida’s Republican-controlled legislature in recent years. This year, supporters were feeling hopeful after a Republican state senator from Miami-Dade County agreed to sponsor the legislation, giving it bipartisan credibility. The Senate Agriculture Committee passed it in a unanimous vote in January. No one testified against it.

“It should have been a no-brainer,” said Karen Woodall, a longtime Florida lobbyist on behalf of social and economic justice issues.

But behind the scenes, trade associations representing some of the state’s largest companies with thousands of outdoor workers expressed concerns that the bill would expose them to lawsuits, Woodall said.

Florida lawmakers have previously supported heat safety legislation. In 2020, they passed a bill designed to prevent heatstroke in student-athletes. But when asked to extend protections to the state’s outdoor workers, many of whom are Latino immigrants from Central and South America, they let the bill die in committee.

Workers in the Southeast have long struggled with the region’s hot and humid summers, but in agricultural communities like Homestead, climate change is magnifying the health risks. A 2020 study by University of Washington and Stanford University researchers found that the average farmworker in the United States endures dangerous levels of heat 21 days per season. If the planet warms by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the number of unsafe work days is expected to nearly double.

Rising temperatures are especially perilous for farm and construction workers, who have the highest heat-related fatality rates.

How many occupational heat deaths there are in the country is difficult to say. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that heat exposure kills an average of 40 workers annually — there were 56 fatalities in 2020, the most recent year for which data is available — and injures more than 3,000. But the government says its figures are “likely vast underestimates” because of underreporting.

It is not just Ascencio struggling in the heat. At a meeting last month of WeCount!, the Miami-Dade immigrant rights organization pushing for a statewide standard, other workers said they had also been sickened. José Delgado, 73, a white-haired man who harvests sweet potatoes, said he has been hospitalized with heatstroke twice in the past five years. Construction worker Andres Villegas, 57, said has seen men with heat illness fall from rooftops and ladders. He had his own close call a few years ago. Farmworkers, landscapers and nursery workers said their bosses don’t provide water or prohibit them from pausing their labor to take a drink, causing headaches, nausea and dizziness.

“We’re seeing temperatures above 100 degrees,” said Ascencio, 50. “We meet workers who tell us that their bosses don’t give them even 10- or 15-minute breaks. They know it’s inhumane to work under those conditions, but they have to pay their bills.”

‘If we give them breaks, it costs us money’

Germany and Spain set maximum indoor temperatures for workplaces. China has measures to prevent heatstroke in indoor and outdoor workers. But there is no national heat standard in the United States.

The Biden administration is moving to protect workers from heat and has directed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, to issue a new rule. But it takes the agency an average of seven years to write new safety standards. The fate of a heat regulation could depend on the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.

That has left it to states. Four of them — California, Washington, Oregon and Minnesota — have broad workplace heat safety regulations. Each is slightly different: California and Washington’s rules apply to outdoor workers; Minnesota’s regulation protects only indoor workers; Oregon’s standard covers both. Colorado has a new heat rule that protects only farmworkers. Maryland passed a law two years ago requiring workplace safety officials to adopt a heat illness regulation by Oct. 1, but the state government still hasn’t released a draft.

While they wait for the federal government to act, worker advocates say preventing heat deaths relies on more states joining this small club. But the challenges are many.

In 2019, Virginia’s Safety and Health Codes Board voted unanimously to begin drafting a heat illness prevention rule. State officials assembled an advisory panel of worker advocates, industry representatives and safety experts. In interviews, six of the panel’s members said participants could not agree on whether a rule was even necessary.

Fulcher served on the panel and said the experience was deeply frustrating. One business representative’s comment so infuriated her that she wrote it down: “If we give them breaks, it costs us money.”

“My reaction was: ‘If you don’t give them breaks, they die, and that costs you money too,’ ” Fulcher said.

Hotter days mean not just more cases of heatstroke but also more accidents and injuries, which can drive up businesses’ insurance and legal costs. A study of California workers’ compensation injury reports found that the number of heat-related injuries declined after 2005, when the state enacted a heat safety rule for outdoor workers on days when temperatures top 95 degrees. Worker advocates took the findings as a positive sign that new regulations could help businesses adapt to global warming. But many industry groups were not swayed.

On the day of the Virginia board’s vote last December, representatives of the agriculture, construction, timber and shellfish industries lined up to oppose the proposed rule.

“It is an unreasonable and unnecessary standard,” said Brandon Robinson, CEO of the Associated General Contractors of Virginia, according to a recording of the session.

“Employees in Virginia are acclimated to their environment and are less impacted by higher temperatures,” said Conner Miller, of the Virginia Forest Products Association. The proposed rule “would be very disruptive.”

The board rejected the proposal by one vote.

Legal obstacles ahead

Across the country, industry leaders and lobbyists have made the same argument: States should put off writing their own rules until a national regulation takes effect. But business interests are working to create doubt about whether a national heat rule is needed — or even legal.

In comments to OSHA, business groups have said that the compliance costs would be extreme and that employers are already doing the right thing.

The American Farm Bureau Federation wrote to the agency, saying it should “partner with employers” on better training materials instead of pursuing a new rule.

The National Cotton Council wrote that many heat-related issues are not caused by farm work or poor management, “but instead result from the modern employee lifestyle in an advanced 21st century global economy.” The group pinned workers’ inability to withstand high temperatures on “present-day luxuries such as air-conditioning” and Americans’ “sedentary lifestyle.”

David Michaels, a professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health and a former OSHA administrator, said industry groups usually fight new federal health and safety standards. But opposition to a heat illness rule is likely to be especially fierce, he said, because it would affect so many sectors of the economy.

“There’s no question this will be expensive,” Michaels said, “but if we think that safe work is a right, then weighing out the cost shouldn’t be part of that calculus.”

In Oregon, trade organizations representing timber and manufacturing companies have filed a lawsuit to stop the state from enforcing new rules protecting workers from heat illness and wildfire smoke. The groups argue that the rules are too vague, too costly and amount to regulatory overreach.

To support this last claim, they appear to borrow from what was ultimately a winning argument before the U.S. Supreme Court, which in January stayed the implementation of the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large companies. The court’s conservative majority found that the coronavirus is not a workplace hazard, but a “universal risk” that is “no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases.”

In their lawsuit, the industry groups argue that Oregon’s heat rule regulates “a societal hazard rather than an occupational hazard.” Worker advocates said they expect industry groups will use the same argument to attack a federal heat rule — and any future workplace protections related to climate change.

For Michael Wheelock, president of Grayback Forestry, a contract wildfire fighting company headquartered in Southern Oregon, complying with the new heat rule has been “cumbersome.”

Wheelock said he has had to buy an ice machine and insulated coolers to keep drinking water cold enough. He also has to monitor the heat index and call the required number of rest breaks.

“There’s a lot of real good-intentioned regulations and I would put this in that category, but it’s pretty broad” he said, adding “I hope they modify it some.”

Water, shade and rest

Without more support from the Florida legislature, WeCount! organizers say their best chance to enact a heat safety law relies on a local campaign. If they can persuade a majority on the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners to support their proposal, they would win new protections for the hundreds of thousands of outdoor workers in the county. It would be the first countywide heat standard in the country.

With plans to put a proposed ordinance before the board as soon as next month, the organization has ramped up its campaigning, deploying day laborers and farmworkers-turned-activists to knock on doors in nearby cities and worker camps.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, Andres Villegas looked down the sidewalk outside a busy commercial strip and saw a woman approaching. He stepped into her path. “Señora, how are you today?” Villegas asked, gently beginning the pitch he hoped would lead to a signature of support, or at least a conversation. But the woman walked away. “There’s heat all over the planet,” she called over her shoulder.

“Many people don’t understand that too much heat is dangerous,” said Villegas. He explained that he had recently seen a roofer fall from a considerable height on a job site. When Villegas reached the man, his co-workers were slapping his cheeks to revive him, playfully needling him for having tripped. But the fallen man didn’t recover until Villegas moved him to a shady spot and doused him with water, lowering his body temperature.

“In the countries these people came from, they and their families worked the land, they fished, they withstood the sun for generations. But the sun today is fiercer,” said Villegas, who emigrated from Mexico. “It’s a constant fight because many people aren’t paying attention.”

His lucked improved. A trio of men in dress shirts, stiff jeans and cowboy boots stopped. Two nodded intently and agreed to sign. They worked in nurseries, growing ornamental palms and trees under plastic tents that trap the heat. “The bosses don’t allow us time to drink water,” one man said, adding that he hides from his supervisors when he’s desperate for a water break.

The following evening, more than 90 workers packed the meeting room in the WeCount! office to hear how the group was going to change all of this. An hour went by as the organizers presented their strategy. The air grew warm and stale. Babies and young children fell asleep on their mothers’ laps.

When Villegas’s turn came, he looked past the weary faces and snickering teenagers in the back. “We are the pioneers of this campaign — and we are growing,” he bellowed into a microphone. “We can’t beg the government, or the politicians, to help us. We have to say it’s their obligation. And we aren’t doing this for a few hundred people, we are doing it for thousands.”

The workers erupted in applause. He and the other canvassers had collected more than 1,000 signatures over the summer, repeating the slogan “water, shade, and rest” until their children knew it by heart. But very few of the people who signed in support could vote — the movement’s strength was not in its power at the ballot box, but in the number of fed-up workers who stood behind it.

Would that be enough? They would soon find out. September was only a month away.

28,"New Ukraine military package is largest yet, Pentagon says","Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The Pentagon on Monday said it is sending Ukraine an additional $1 billion in military assistance, including tens of thousands more munitions and explosives — the largest such package since Russia launched its invasion in February. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The announcement comes as Ukrainian forces undertake a counteroffensive aimed at reclaiming the southern city of Kherson. The operation is seen in Kyiv and in Washington as a vital bid to prevent the Kremlin from making good on its vow to absorb occupied territories via planned referendums. Senior U.S. officials have denounced Moscow’s annexation plan as a “sham.”

The new security assistance package includes ammunition for the high-mobility artillery rocket systems known as HIMARS and 75,000 howitzer rounds, as well as mortar systems, surface-to-air missiles, Javelin anti-armor missiles, Claymore mines and demolition explosives. It pushes the total U.S. military support for Ukraine past $9 billion since the war began, officials said.

“These are all critical capabilities to help the Ukrainians repel the Russian offensive in the east and also to address evolving developments in the south and elsewhere,” said Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl. He characterized the package as comprising the types of weaponry “the Ukrainian people are using so effectively to defend their country.”

Kahl said the Russian military has encountered considerable setbacks as a result of U.S. efforts to arm and equip Ukraine, indicating its forces have suffered an estimated 70,000 to 80,000 casualties in the past six months. The figure includes personnel killed and wounded, he said.

But the counteroffensive in Kherson will probably be a challenge for Ukrainian forces.

The government in Kyiv has signaled for weeks that it intends to move on the city, which before the invasion was home to approximately 300,000. And while the Ukrainians’ efforts have already helped recover some nearby villages, Russian units have taken notice, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior research scientist at the think tank CNA and an expert on the Russian military.

It remains to be seen, he added, whether Washington’s latest arms transfer will prove sufficient to enable the Ukrainians to achieve their immediate objectives.

“The Russians have redeployed a lot of defenses … in that area,” Gorenburg said. “Kherson is a large city. And the same problems of attacking a large city that the Russians faced in the early stages of their attack, the Ukrainians would face if the Russians chose to defend it.”

While the influx of munitions and antitank systems in Monday’s aid package are “good for stopping offensives,” Gorenburg said, “it’s not necessarily going to be as useful if you’ve got a bunch of infantry dug in.”

In Ukraine, the sense of urgency is dire, officials say. President Volodymyr Zelensky told members of Congress late last month that his military had only a few weeks to change the course of the war — a timeline driven in part by Russia’s threat to annex parts of occupied Ukraine as soon as next month and by the knowledge that the operation would become exponentially more complicated if it drags into the winter.

Ukrainian leaders have pleaded with the West for more HIMARS, which along with other sophisticated weapons systems have enabled them to destroy Russian command posts, ammunition depots, air-defense sites, radar and communication nodes, and long-range artillery positions. To date, they have received 16 U.S.-produced systems, three British-made equivalents, and a promise from Germany that another three will be delivered, according to Kahl.

Zelensky’s top advisers have said they need dozens more if Ukraine is to drive back the Russian advance. When asked Monday if the absence of additional HIMARS was an indication that the United States was running low on its stock of the systems, Kahl declined to answer directly.

The weapons, he said, have been “very effective in hitting things” while making it “more difficult for Russia to move forces around the battlefield.” The Pentagon, Kahl added, is committed to “delivering weapons from the United States’ stocks when they are available.”

Though the long-range precision capabilities of HIMARS are not particularly suited to the close-range combat of a slow-moving counteroffensive, they have been useful in keeping Russian logistics — the weak underbelly that crippled its effort to sack Kyiv early in the war — on the back foot, experts say. By targeting Russian munitions depots within occupied parts of Ukraine, HIMARS strikes have made it more complicated for Russia to resupply its own front lines, causing “havoc in the supply lines” that could provide Ukraine with openings to make additional gains, Gorenburg said.

But the Ukrainian military has to be ready to take advantage of such opportunities, he said. Though Western governments have steadily pledged military assistance to Ukraine, in many cases the promised munitions have been slow to reach the front lines.

According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, as of July 1, the United States and Germany had delivered less than half of the military aid announced for Ukraine. (The institute said it plans to update its figures this month.)

But Zelensky wants his benefactors to do more than provide arms to help his country stave off the threat of annexation, a looming fate made more real Monday when the Russian-appointed head of the occupation administration in Zaporizhzhia signed a decree to move forward with a Sept. 11 referendum.

In an interview, Zelensky told The Washington Post that the United States and its allies should take the unprecedented step of banning all Russian travelers from their countries.

“The most important sanctions are to close the borders — because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land,” Zelensky said. Russians should “live in their own world,” he added, “until they change their philosophy.”

30,Accounting of bodies in Bucha nears completion,"Europe Accounting of bodies in Bucha nears completion Workers in protective gear exhume bodies of civilians found in a mass grave behind Saint Andrews Church in Bucha, Ukraine on April 13. (Heidi Levine for The Washington Post)

BUCHA, Ukraine — After months of meticulous, painful and at times gruesome investigation, officials in Bucha said Monday that they had reached what may be the closest they will get to a final accounting of victims of the murderous rampage by Russian troops that set off worldwide outrage over alleged atrocities: 458 bodies, of which 419 bore markings they had been shot, tortured or bludgeoned to death.

Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska, the town’s deputy mayor, recounted that grim tally at a news conference Monday, where she said the details of each case were now being investigated by prosecutors working to identify the perpetrators and ultimately try them for war crimes.

Of the victims, 39 appeared to have died of natural causes, Skoryk-Shkarivska said, but those may have been related to the war or to the Russians’ treatment of the civilian population during their month-long occupation, which ended with a hasty retreat in defeat on April 1.

Even those 39 cases are now being scrutinized by war crimes investigators. They include a seemingly healthy 34-year old mother who died of a heart attack while sheltering from bombardments in a basement with her three young children, who remained trapped alongside their dead mother for days, and an elderly woman living alone with her sister who died shortly after her sister was shot by Russian troops — deaths that hardly could be considered natural.

That it has taken more than four months to account for 32 days’ worth of killing underscores the horrific circumstances officials encountered when the Russians troops left. Bodies were strewn unattended around the streets, stuffed into wells or abandoned deep in the forest. Electricity and internet service had been cut, meaning the earliest documented evidence had to be written by hand, Skoryk-Shkarivska said.

Identifying all of the bodies proved impossible. Some 50 corpses remain unidentified or unclaimed by relatives, Skoryk-Shkarivska said, adding that city officials nonetheless decided to announce their findings because the final tally, and complete identities, likely will never be known. Just in the past two weeks, two more bodies were discovered, in a forest and a storm drain, and 10 residents have reported missing relatives who cannot be accounted for.

The final figure also includes one bag of body parts. The remains were too fragmented, decomposed or badly mutilated to be identified, but apparently belonged to multiple people, Skoryk-Shkarivska said, perhaps including some Russian soldiers. Among the pieces are two right arms that investigators say they have reason to suspect belonged to Russians.

The Russian troops left the corpses of many of those they killed to rot unattended, but also burned some, possibly out of hygiene concerns or to hide evidence of torture, the deputy mayor said. Some of the remains consisted of piles of ashes beyond identification even using DNA analysis.

Nearly all of the bodies included in Monday’s tally are known to have been civilians, Skoryk-Shkarivska said. The bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in Bucha were turned over to Ukrainian authorities and counted separately, while three Russian bodies were sent for repatriation.

A total of 366 of the bodies were male, and 86 were female, while five had deteriorated too badly to determine. Nine were children under age 18.

The stark numbers offer only a hint of the horrors inflicted on the small number of people who remained behind after the Russians swept into the Kyiv suburb on Feb. 27, intent on reaching the capital 20 miles away. Instead, they found their advance blunted by fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Most of the town’s estimated 39,000 population escaped before the Russians arrived, but some 4,000 remained – one in 10 of whom died in just over a month.

If such numbers are being repeated in only a fraction of the towns and villages currently under Russian occupation — amounting to 20 percent of Ukrainian territory — the full scale of atrocities committed by Russian troops could be vast.

Bucha, however, experienced by far some of the worst of the violence among the dozens of towns and settlements briefly occupied by Russian troops in the Kyiv region, accounting for a third of the estimated total of 1,300 victims.

Many of those who stayed in Bucha when the Russians invaded were elderly, refusing to flee because they were too frail, sick or stubborn to leave their homes, said Father Andriy Halavin, the priest of the town’s church.

He helped bury 116 people killed in the first two weeks of the Russian occupation in a mass grave dug by residents in the yard of his church, and recognized some of his congregants. But others may have relatives who live far away and were unable to provide DNA samples to help investigators.

Records compiled by the investigators indicate that many of those unidentified were also elderly, said Eugene Spirin, one of the volunteers who helped collect and identify the dead. He shared a list documenting some of those that proved hardest to identify, accompanied by brief descriptions of what investigators were able to establish about who they were.

There is the man, about 60 years old, shot in the eye, his face barely recognizable. and another aged 75 to 85 with stubby gray hair who was shot in the back of the head. One elderly woman’s head was so badly smashed it could not be recognized. Investigators assessed that she was 75 to 85 years old, according to the records.

Skoryk-Shkarivska said the effort to identify these victims will continue. The city is determined to put a name to every one of those who died and memorialize them with a monument. But if final answers don’t come soon, the city said it plans to hold burial services for the last remaining victims who died lonely, nameless deaths.

31,Ashton Kutcher says he is ‘lucky to be alive’ after battling vasculitis,"Listen 3 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

For about a year, Ashton Kutcher had difficulty seeing, hearing and walking. The actor revealed his battle with vasculitis — an autoimmune disease that inflames the blood vessels — in an upcoming episode of National Geographic’s “Running Wild With Bear Grylls: The Challenge.” According to a clip of the episode, Kutcher spoke of his health struggles while hiking through a thick forest with adventurer Bear Grylls, the show’s host.

“You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone, until you go, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever gonna be able to see again. I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to hear again, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to walk again,’ ” said Kutcher, who is known for his roles in “That ’70s Show” and “The Butterfly Effect.”

“I’m lucky to be alive,” he added.

In the preview, Grylls called Kutcher’s experience with vasculitis “a terrifying journey,” but one that made the actor strong and resilient. “What do they say in survival? Storms make you stronger, and I think he is living proof of that,” Grylls added.

It is not clear which type of vasculitis Kutcher suffered from — severity and length vary by type — or what triggered his case, but most types of the condition are considered rare. Those who have vasculitis often suffer from swelling of the blood vessels that reduces blood flow and may lead to tissue damage.

The most common symptoms include fever, headache and fatigue; depending on the body parts affected, the ailment can also cause ringing in the ears, numbness in the extremities and bleeding in the lungs. Complications from vasculitis can be as severe as blindness or aneurysms.

The causes of vasculitis aren’t fully understood, but medication and infections have been triggers in some cases. The condition can be “short term” or “long lasting,” according to the Mayo Clinic. Corticosteroids are usually prescribed to vasculitis patients to help manage inflammation, though the side effects of long-term steroid use can be significant.

The mystery surrounding the autoimmune disease deepened during the coronavirus pandemic. Health authorities in New York City and in the United Kingdom warned last year of a possible link between covid-19 and Kawasaki disease, a kind of vasculitis that mainly occurs in young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said researchers are trying to learn more about what might trigger the onset of Kawasaki disease, and doctors cautioned against drawing hasty connections.

Complications from the disease killed comedy director, writer and actor Harold Ramis in 2014. Ramis, who appeared in a long list of comedy classics like “Ghostbusters” and “Groundhog Day,” had to relearn how to walk after being stricken with the ailment and died three years after a relapse, the Chicago Tribune reported.

32,"Issey Miyake, Japanese fashion designer known as the prince of pleats, dies","Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Designer Issey Miyake, known in the fashion world as the prince of pleats and for his innovative cuts and bold style, has died of cancer. He was 84. His studio, Miyake Design Office, said Tuesday that he died on Aug. 5 of liver cancer, according to the Associated Press.

The pioneering designer, who became a star in the 1970s shortly after he formed his studio, was best known for his origami-style pleated clothing that never wrinkles and for making Apple founder Steve Jobs’s signature black turtlenecks.

Japan’s public media organization NHK reported that a family funeral has taken place and that there will be no further public events, in keeping with Miyake’s wishes.

His clothes weren’t form-fitting like those of his Western counterparts, as he championed freedom of movement and put special emphasis on each piece of cloth to begin his sleek designs. They were often made with minimal decoration and detail, in sweeping shapes and block colors.

Miyake always stayed true to his “core design style — creating clothes from original materials starting with the research of a single thread,” a technique that “transcended generations” and “broke the boundaries between East and West,” his studio’s website says.

“To me, clothes should not be things which confine or enclose the body … clothes should make one free,” Miyake said in a lecture in Washington in 1998. “Maybe I make tools. People buy the clothes and the clothes become tools for the wearer’s creativity,” he added.

His designs have been worn by a trove of celebrities and put on display in museums around the world. There are 136 Miyake stores in Japan and 134 others worldwide. He went on to design handbags, watches and fragments before stepping back in 1997.

Miyake, who was born in Hiroshima in southern Japan in 1938, was 7 when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city in 1945, killing tens of thousands, including his mother, who died of radiation exposure three years later, he wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times in 2009. He said he had never wanted “to be defined by my past.”

“I did not want to be labeled ‘the designer who survived the atomic bomb,’ and therefore I have always avoided questions about Hiroshima. They made me uncomfortable,” he wrote as he urged President Barack Obama to visit the city during an Asian tour. “But now I realize it is a subject that must be discussed if we are ever to rid the world of nuclear weapons.”

“I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience,” he wrote. “A bright red light, the black cloud soon after, people running in every direction trying desperately to escape — I remember it all.”

Miyake went on to study graphic design at a Tokyo art university, according to Reuters, and then clothing design in Paris, where he worked as an apprentice for fashion designers Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy. He later moved to New York and then back to Tokyo.

Apple co-founder Jobs told his biographer that he had asked the Japanese designer to make him a uniform for his company’s staff, but that idea was quickly dismissed by employees. Jobs, who died at 56 in 2011, took to wearing the black shirts, often paired with stiff blue jeans and white sneakers.

“So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them,” Jobs said, showing off a stack in his wardrobe. “I have enough to last for the rest of my life.”

Suliman reported from London, Inuma from Tokyo.

Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! Today in weird and relatable news, climate change is prematurely aging lizards. 🦎 But first: Inside the debate over the climate impact of ConocoPhillips's Willow project Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Is a massive oil project on Alaska's North Slope an environmentally responsible proposal or a ticking time bomb for the planet? It depends on whom you ask.

According to a new analysis released Tuesday by the Center for American Progress, a preeminent liberal think tank, ConocoPhillips's Willow project would produce up to 287 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next 30 years. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of 76 coal-fired power plants — a third of all coal plants in the United States.

But according to ConocoPhillips, CAP's analysis is misleading and inaccurate. In reality, the company argues, the Willow project would have a modest environmental footprint in comparison to the nation's coal plants. And it would provide desperately needed energy and jobs for the region and the country.

The debate has enormous implications for President Biden's ambitious climate agenda, which calls for cutting U.S. emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030. It comes as the administration weighs whether to approve the multibillion-dollar effort to expand oil infrastructure on the nation's single largest block of public land.

Here's a look at both sides of the ongoing debate over the project — and why it matters for Biden and the planet:

The context

ConocoPhillips's proposal for Willow includes hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, airstrips, a gravel mine and a major new processing facility — all in the middle of pristine Arctic tundra and wetland.

The dispute over the project's emissions spans several months:

In March , CAP published a Interior Department approves Willow, it would , CAP published a report titled “The Biden administration’s easiest climate win is waiting in the Arctic.” The report asserted that if theapproves Willow, it would negate the emissions avoided by meeting Biden's near-term goals for deploying more renewable energy on public lands and waters.

In April , ConocoPhillips drafted a , ConocoPhillips drafted a six-page rebuttal of the report that was shared with The Washington Post. The oil giant argued that CAP had made “statements and assertions that are factually inaccurate, logically flawed, and segregated from appropriate context for comparison and understanding.”

In July , the Interior Department released a , thereleased a new environmental assessment of Willow but declined to reveal whether it was leaning toward approving the controversial project.

And today, CAP released the new analysis — based on Interior's environmental assessment — concluding that Willow could generate up to 287 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 30 years. ConocoPhillips also disputes this analysis.

The crux of the matter

Now that we've laid out the context, let's review the heart of the debate. While the disagreement is complicated, it largely centers on a hypothetical situation in which the Willow project were not developed.

ConocoPhillips argues that in this scenario, greenhouse gases would continue to be emitted because the market would substitute other energy supplies to meet demand. Therefore, the oil giant says, Willow would only result in a net increase of roughly 35 million metric tons over 30 years — just 0.15 percent of the annual carbon output of U.S. coal plants.

Environmental Protection Agency's CAP argues that it's irrelevant to speculate about what might happen if Willow were not developed. Instead, the center says, Interior has a duty to consider what might happen if the project moves forward. And Interior's own analysis shows that Willow could pump up to 287 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — equivalent to operating 76 coal plants for a year, according to the's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator

What they're saying

In an email, ConocoPhillips spokesman Dennis Nuss said that CAP “continues to misconstrue emissions numbers and timelines to create misleading comparisons to what remains an environmentally and socially responsible project.”

Nuss added that “when complete, Willow will promote U.S. energy security, provide employment in the state of Alaska, and generate public revenue directed to North Slope communities for healthcare, roads, schools and other essential services.”

Jenny Rowland-Shea, CAP's director of public lands and the author of the new analysis, countered that Willow would be a “carbon bomb” at a time when “scientists and others are saying the U.S. urgently needs to move off fossil fuels” to meet global climate targets.

“We really, really can't afford to have this project happen,” she said.

Pressure points

Despite rising heat, industries push against safeguards for workers

As extreme heat becomes more common due to climate change, industry groups are fighting to prevent new regulations aimed at protecting employees from heat-related illness, Anna Phillips reports for The Washington Post.

Although more progressive places along the West Coast have adopted workplace rules to address heat exposure, many other states’ attempts to require safeguards have been either blocked or weakened by major companies, according to public records and those involved in efforts to write new rules.

The new standards could require companies to give workers water, shade and rest breaks, or set statewide maximum heat temperatures for workplaces. But companies argue that the regulations would expose them to lawsuits, cost a lot of money, represent a regulatory overreach and increase the burden on businesses to enforce the rule.

Some advocates are concerned that if the federal government establishes a heat rule or some other workplace protection related to climate change — which the Biden administration says it plans to do — it would face legal pushback from industry groups arguing that the hazard presented by the heat is not unique to the workplace, but rather is a universal risk.

Meanwhile, if the planet remains on its current track of warming by 2 degrees Celsius, the number of unsafe work days is expected to nearly double. Already, heat exposure kills an average of 40 workers annually and injures more than 3,000, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The government says these figures are “likely vast underestimates” because of underreporting.

Biden surveys flood damage in Kentucky, pledges more federal help

President Biden on Monday surveyed the damage from devastating storms last month that caused the worst flooding in Kentucky's history and killed at least 37 people, pledging to expand federal support until residents are back on their feet, Seung Min Kim, Chris Megerian and Bruce Schreiner report for the Associated Press.

Biden stressed that politics have no place in federal disaster response, despite his frequent clashes with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who led all 50 Senate Republicans in opposing Democrats' climate and tax package.

“We battle all the times on issues,” Biden said, but in helping Kentuckians rebuild, “we’re all one team.”

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One that the floods in Kentucky are “yet another reminder of the intensifying and accelerating impacts of climate change and the urgent needs to invest in making our communities more resilient to it.”

Monday's trip was Biden's second visit to Kentucky since taking office last year. He previously visited in December after a string of tornadoes whipped across the state, killing 77 people and leaving a trail of destruction.

On the Hill

Democrats’ climate bill could bring more offshore wind to the U.S.

A little-noticed provision in the tax and climate bill passed by the Senate on Sunday would open up waters off the coasts of Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S. territories to offshore wind development for the first time, Jennifer A Dlouhy reports for Bloomberg News.

Advertisement

The provision in the Inflation Reduction Act, which the House is expected to pass on Friday, would reverse a decades-old quirk in federal law that barred renewable energy developers from pursuing offshore wind energy leases in the five U.S. territories. It would also require the Interior Department to seek public comment on potential offshore wind lease sales there.

The proposal comes as the island territories, which are largely dependent on oil and gas for electricity, are being increasingly hit by worsening extreme weather events due to human-caused climate change.

“The territories need to be able to diversify their energy,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore oil, gas and wind firms.

34,Perseids are the year’s best meteor shower,"Gift Article Share

Go outside tonight and look up. Chances are, you’ll see a bunch of shooting stars! But what are shooting stars, actually? And why are they easier to see on some nights than others? “The technical term for a shooting star is a ‘meteor,’ ” says Carrie Nugent, a planetary scientist at the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts and author of the book “Asteroid Hunters.”

To understand where meteors come from, we need to first understand a few other objects found in space.

For example, there are comets, which are big balls of dust, gas and ice flying through the solar system. There are also asteroids, which are similar to comets but made only of rock.

Both comets and asteroids orbit the sun, and as they do, comets especially can begin to melt and leave behind a trail of debris, like the slime trail left behind by a snail, says Nugent. When the Earth travels through one of those trails, all those chunks of space junk slam into our atmosphere, where they heat up so much that they glow.

This is what you’re seeing when you see a shooting star — superhot space objects burning up in Earth’s atmosphere.

Most meteors disintegrate before they reach Earth, but sometimes a piece of rock is big and strong enough to crash where we can find it. These are called meteorites. Even though they’re from space, we can actually pick them up and study them, says Nugent. Once they cool off, of course!

Each August, the Earth travels through the path of debris left behind by the Comet Swift-Tuttle, and this creates a meteor shower known as the Perseids (pronounced per-SEE-ids). While shooting stars can be seen any night of the year, looking for them during the Perseid Meteor Shower means a lot more meteors per hour than normal.

As for the best way to see meteors, Nugent has a few tips. “You want to be in the darkest place you can easily find,” she says. “But you can absolutely see them from a nice balcony in a big city. You might just have to be patient.”

“My pro astronomer tip is that the best way to see a meteor shower is with a friend and a mug of hot chocolate. That way, the time passes a little bit faster,” says Nugent.

By the way, Nugent knows what she’s talking about. Not only has she officially named more than 20 asteroids, she’s also had a 4.5-mile-long asteroid named after her. “It’s in the main belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. It orbits the sun. And it’s fairly dark in color,” she says.

If you like looking for shooting stars, maybe one day you can name a piece of space rock, too!",https://www.washingtonpost.com
35,"White House falls short in efforts to address soaring rent, advocates say","Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The White House hasn’t done enough to fight rent inflation, says a coalition of tenant unions, community organizations and legal groups calling on the Biden administration to launch an all-out government response to intervene. Share with The Post: What’s one way you’ve felt the impact of inflation? ArrowRight A set of proposals, shared with The Washington Post, calls on the Biden administration to declare a state of emergency on housing and explore ways to regulate rents. The proposals span six government agencies and are intended to push federal regulators to consider new ways to curb rental costs, which were up 5.8 percent in June compared with the year before.

Overall prices are up 9.1 percent compared with last year, and inflation remains the top economic problem facing households, businesses and policymakers alike.

In recent months, the Biden administration has come under enormous pressure to find any means of slashing gas prices, another major way people feel inflation in their daily lives. The White House has responded with oil releases and by calling on Congress to consider a gas tax holiday, which didn’t happen.

Advocates want the same urgency and solutions for housing, calling it its own economic crisis.

“We urge the President to act immediately to regulate rents, as part of the Administration’s efforts to curb inflation, and as a critical foundation for long term protections to correct the imbalance of power between tenants and their landlords,” according to a memo the coalition sent to National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and other White House advisers.

The effort, part of a campaign called Homes Guarantee, comes one week after the White House held a summit on its efforts to prevent evictions during the pandemic and keep financial support flowing to struggling renters. During an online forum, White House officials touted progress under the Emergency Rental Assistance program, which was propped up in the thick of the covid crisis to stave off a wave of evictions once a federal moratorium was no longer in place.

Advertisement

While the money was exceedingly slow to go out at first, the program ramped up. Some $40 billion, out of a $46 billion pot, has been obligated or spent, according to the Treasury Department, and eviction filings nationally remain below their historical averages.

While the summit was presented as a kind of victory lap, Biden administration officials acknowledged there is more work to do, especially as soaring rents narrow the options where families can afford to live. Redfin data shows that in May, the median monthly asking rent in the United States surpassed $2,000 for the first time, with rental increases spanning the nation.

“The question is, are we content to let this first-ever national infrastructure for eviction reduction crumble?” Gene Sperling, coordinator of the American Rescue Plan, the 2021 pandemic relief package, said at last week’s summit. “Or are we going to build on it and strengthen it and make permanent gains?”

A big reason housing costs are soaring is that there just aren’t enough homes. The United States needs 1.5 million to 5 million housing units built, according to a broad range of economic estimates. In May, the White House unveiled its Housing Supply Action Plan, which aims to close the country’s housing shortfall in five years.

But those investments would do little to combat rental inflation now. Curbing inflation is the job of the Federal Reserve, which has launched an aggressive effort to bring prices down through interest rate hikes. But the Fed cannot target any specific parts of the economy, let alone build houses, leaving more tailored solutions to elected officials.

“Tenants have to pay their rent every month, and the alternative is homelessness,” said Tara Raghuveer, Homes Guarantee’s campaign director. “If the president intends to take meaningful action to curb inflation, he must be serious about using every available authority to regulate the rent.”

Specifically, the coalition wants a Cabinet-level task force to look into regulating rents and securing legal help for tenants in eviction proceedings. Advocates also want the Treasury Department to issue new rules that direct state and local grantees to keep landlords from increasing rent beyond a certain amount as a condition of receiving rental aid.

Advertisement

They say the Department of Housing and Urban Development should look into whether rising rents are contributing to inequality and preventing access to fair housing. And the group wants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to impose rent regulations on all borrowers of federally backed mortgages.

Zonnie Thompson, 23, lives in one of those properties in Stockton, Calif. His rent recently went from $1,500 to $1,700. As part of a tenant delegation, Thompson is traveling to Washington this week to discuss solutions with the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

“We want them to commit to working with organizations across the country, such as our own, to roll out policies that will protect tenants and increase their ability to stay in their homes — without forfeiting a majority of their paycheck to rent,” Thompson said.

36,"State supreme courts could soon decide on abortion, raising stakes of their midterm races","Listen 10 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Mary Kay O’Brien had been working for a year to drum up interest in her campaign for Illinois Supreme Court, struggling to convince voters that it would affect them as a presidential or gubernatorial race would. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But “within 24 hours” of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end federal protections for abortions, levels of interest in judicial races like hers skyrocketed, said O’Brien, a Democratic appellate judge.

“There’s no question that it energized and mobilized, especially young people and women,” she said. “It’s something that I think was just a complete alarm bell to some people.”

All over the country, the Dobbs decision has drawn attention to the power of state judiciaries, transforming once-sleepy races into high-energy elections that could bring out voters focused on abortion and other civil rights issues, candidates, legal experts and party officials said. Even where abortion has not yet been on the docket since the fall of Roe v. Wade, courts are making decisions on hot-button issues from gerrymandering to affirmative action.

Advertisement

In Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and North Carolina, which have partisan elections for state supreme court, this year’s races could determine which party controls the state’s top court, according to the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. They are among the 30 states holding state supreme court elections this year, with 85 seats on the ballot, according to a Ballotpedia database, though many of those are nonpartisan races or elections to retain a sitting judge, like in Kansas.

In the nine states that hold partisan elections for state supreme court, candidates are barred from stating how they would rule on a specific case or issue. Instead, they rely on highlighting the types of cases they might rule on if elected or drumming up interest in the judiciary generally, which has become easier since Dobbs, candidates said.

“The second you say you’re on the state supreme court, they’re suddenly very interested in my election and generally don’t pass me by and get irritated, which they might have done before,” said Briana Zamora, a New Mexico State Supreme Court justice running to keep her seat. “They are very interested in understanding more about what impact we have as a state supreme court on their rights.”

Advertisement

Zamora added that Democratic county chairs in New Mexico are organizing rallies and canvassing events specific to judicial candidates for the first time.

In recent years, issues such as abortion and gun control have made judicial elections more political and polarizing, said Richard Briffault, an election law expert and professor at Columbia Law School.

“My guess is some combination of the 2020 election and all the focus on election decisions, and now Roe and Dobbs and maybe some stuff on gun-control legislation, where the Supreme Court has put them in the news, so you’re likely to see them contested in state elections,” Briffault said.

Even before Dobbs, state judicial races were attracting more money, with the 2019-20 election cycle setting a record of $97 million spent on state court elections nationwide, according to a report from Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School.

“States that have contested elections are going to see a ton of money coming in,” said Billy Corriher, an author who focuses on state courts and judicial independence.

A judge’s political affiliation isn’t always indicative of how they will rule — the Republican-led Ohio Supreme Court struck down a GOP-drawn congressional map as gerrymandered earlier this year — but the elections are increasingly drawing the attention of partisan groups.

The Republican State Legislative Committee, which typically backs legislative candidates, is pledging more than $5 million for state judicial races this year — a record — though most will be focused on states where redistricting is an issue, according to its spokesman, Andrew Romeo.

Its Democratic equivalent, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, plans to support judicial candidates for the first time this election cycle, spokeswoman Gabrielle Chew said.

“Our main focus still remains state legislatures, but we know that state Supreme Courts wield tremendous power over state laws like abortion access, redistricting maps, and election implementation,” Chew said in a statement. “Like state legislatures, Democrats historically have overlooked them to their detriment. Here at the DLCC, we’re looking to change that.”

In Illinois, a group of progressive political operatives launched an organization last month dedicated to increasing awareness of the state Supreme Court race, according to co-founder Terry Cosgrove.

Democrats, in particular, see state supreme court races as a way to bring out supporters if they can convince them the races could have a direct effect on their right to an abortion. In Kansas, a referendum to remove abortion protections from the state’s constitution failed amid unexpectedly high turnout, including from independents and Republicans.

Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said the party will try to convince Texas voters that supporting Democratic justices will achieve a “much quicker result” in protecting abortion rights, as opposed to trying to end the filibuster and pass a federal guarantee in the U.S. Senate, for example.

Advertisement

Hinojosa said he hopes for a repeat of 2018, when Democrats beat 19 incumbent Republicans on the state’s appellate courts, giving the party a majority on half of the state’s 14 appeals courts.

Texas Republican Party Chair Matt Rinaldi said in a statement that GOP enthusiasm for judicial races was already high before Dobbs, pointing to a record number of candidates filing for judicial office and high turnout in the March primary.

“As the U.S. Supreme Court continues to abate liberal policies and return to government by the Constitution, we anticipate even stronger enthusiasm for our judicial candidates,” Rinaldi added.

In Fannin County, Tex., which voted for Trump by 63 points in 2018, Erin Nowell said she heard from a group of older White women who were upset and recalling their experiences pre-Roe at a recent club meeting.

Advertisement

“It’s affecting so many people that those low-propensity voters are more energized,” said the appellate judge running for Texas Supreme Court as a Democrat. “They have a reason that, hey, this is why you need to come out and vote, and so we’re seeing more energy and more motivation and more surge in people who might have sat it out.”

Michigan State Rep. Kyra Harris Bolden (D), who is running for state Supreme Court, is nine months pregnant, something she has made a focal point of her campaign.

“I think I get more pregnancy questions than issue questions,” she said. “I want people to feel that they have something to vote for and not just against, and be excited to vote and excited to vote for me.”

New Mexico Democratic Party chair Jessica Velasquez said it has been a challenge in the past to find volunteers to knock on doors for judicial candidates, but the Dobbs decision “really fired up our base here.”

Advertisement

“When I’m talking to donors on the phones, the judiciary comes up in almost every single conversation, and that is something brand new,” Velasquez said, adding that county party organizers are hosting judicial-specific campaign events in response to the enthusiasm.

Thomas Montoya, an Albuquerque lawyer running for New Mexico Supreme Court as a Republican, said he expects to get more questions about abortion in the coming months thanks to Dobbs, but plans to make clear to voters he would not take a position on such an issue without hearing the facts of a case first.

“The Supreme Court is not a legislative body, as Dobbs pointed out, nor should it be,” Montoya said. “So if anyone were to make a policy decision in seeking a judicial role, that’s a clear disqualification — we don’t decide policy issues.”

Advertisement

North Carolina has been plagued with legal battles over the state’s congressional maps, with conflicts playing out in its courts over partisan gerrymandering. In February, the state Supreme Court struck down redistricting maps and ordered the legislature to redraw them, a dispute that delayed North Carolina’s primary elections.

Democrats hold a razor-thin 4-3 majority on the high court, and the Roe and Dobbs decisions have upped the stakes for this November’s race.

Shortly after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) signed an executive order ensuring people in the state could access an abortion, which is still legal there. North Carolina has been inundated with people traveling there to receive a legal abortion, local news media have reported.

Republicans in the GOP-led state legislature have not made plans to pursue abortion legislation this year because Cooper would veto laws that are passed, but the two seats up for election on the state Supreme Court this year could give Republicans the majority.

“So reproductive rights might not be talked about by the candidates, but it’s on the ballot in so many states right now,” Corriher said.

While there is some discussion on the U.S. Supreme Court rulings, they have not been dominating election conversations for the state’s GOP, said Michael Whatley, chairman of the party.

Whatley said the most important issues in the state are inflation, gas prices and the southern border. He added that the party has been focusing on raising money for its Judicial Victory Fund, while staying on “high alert” for the recent Supreme Court decisions.

“Fortunately, we had already built this apparatus and were ready to go when the decisions came down,” Whatley said.

On the ground, judicial candidates are seeing more grass-roots engagement and enthusiasm with their campaigns ahead of races in November, where prominent issues such as abortion could be at stake.

“We’re in the middle of summer parade season — normally when we show up in past cycles, judges are kind of at the back of the pack,” said Brian Morris, who leads the New Mexico Democrats’ efforts on judicial races. “Judges are up in front and center now.”

37,Rising rents add to college students’ scramble for affordable housing,"Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The end of summer is always stressful for Jordan Hubbard, as he tries to find a place to live for the upcoming semester. This year is even worse: Military benefits that helped him pay for tuition and housing at New York University ended this spring. He needs the money he’s earning from two jobs this summer, as well as a stipend for his role in student government, to pay for classes.

He knows some people whose parents can help them rent places in the neighborhoods near their NYU classes, but he knows many low-income students are crowding into apartments a long subway ride away from campus. “All I see on my Instagram feed is … ‘Who’s subletting? Who’s looking for roommates?’” he said.

It’s scary, Hubbard said, shortly before the start of his senior year. “I have no way to pay for any kind of housing.”

Surging rental costs and greater demand for traditional campus life after the disruptions of the pandemic have students at some universities scrambling to find housing. At schools struggling with long wait lists for university housing, efforts to accommodate students have led to some unusual solutions.

Housing “is a beast right now,” said Ron Hall, a senior who leads student government at NYU. Sometimes, he said, “students are shut off from being able to come to school because of the housing costs.”

Colleges’ ability to draw students, and their surrounding markets, vary dramatically, and some schools are grappling with declining enrollment. But at some campuses and in some regions, housing issues are acute.

In California, the state is pouring money into building new student housing at public universities, after shortages and legal battles escalated in some college towns. A lawsuit claimed the University of California at Berkeley’s enrollment and resulting demand for scarce housing were straining nearby neighborhoods and forcing longtime residents from their homes, leading to a court order to cap enrollment that was later overturned by state leaders. Berkeley has also faced multiple starts and stops on a project at a park near campus that would include more than 1,000 beds for students.

“The university has faced legal challenges around almost every single housing project it has launched in recent years,” spokesman Dan Mogulof said.

Meanwhile, some of the state’s community colleges, traditionally commuter schools for students juggling jobs and classes, are now planning to build dorms. The University of California at Los Angeles has promised that all incoming freshmen, beginning this fall, will be guaranteed campus housing for up to four years.

The urgency is hard to overstate, said Alex Niles, 21, a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara who is chair of government relations for the University of California Student Association. Last year, he said, “There were students living in illegal subleases and garages, way too many students sleeping in cars parked on the street, or couch-surfing. It’s really common to have 13 students to a house,” he said, with bunk beds cramming four or more students into a room. “Rents are sky-high.”

At Virginia Commonwealth University, senior Sabeeka Khan said a lot of people struggle to pay rent, using their student loans to cover it and worrying near the end of the year when the loan money is drying up. Some students can’t afford to live in safer neighborhoods in Richmond, she said.

At Florida Atlantic University, many more students are asking to live on campus now than before the pandemic. The biggest factor, said Larry Faerman, the acting vice president of student affairs at FAU, is the cost of rentals in the area: He said they have roughly doubled in the past year or 15 months. The cost of driving has gone up, as well.

The school had a wait list of more than 800 students hoping for campus housing in the spring who had to look for alternatives. “I don’t know how many of them will elect not to return to school if they can’t find accommodations,” he said.

They also found that more students than usual held onto their campus housing for the fall. This year, the school has about 175 more students who have signed contracts than it can house. FAU will give those students rooms in local hotels — at the cost of student housing — and provide some transportation to and from campus.

Advertisement

The school is also planning to offer more classes online, he said, to let students learn away from campus.

At the University of Utah, the wait list for housing exceeded 3,500 students this spring.

University officials are planning new residential buildings, but took several interim steps this summer to ease the gap. They sublet an apartment building owned by nearby Westminster College, and plan to use nearly 300 rooms at an on-campus hotel for students this year.

They’re also launching a pilot program to connect students with graduates as far as 45 miles away from campus who are willing to provide housing. The university will charge a flat $5,000-per-semester fee to students and pay that to alumni for rooms or apartments in their homes — or direct it to a scholarship fund, if alumni want to donate. That’s significantly less than the typical rate for a studio apartment near campus, said Bethany Hardwig, director of special projects and outreach in the Office of Alumni Relations.

Advertisement

There is so much need for housing, Hardwig said, that one graduate told her that within an hour of posting an available apartment, 100 people had filled out a form in response. “That just felt really unmanageable,” she said.

Linda Dunn, who has multiple ties to the university, has extra room in her house several miles from campus — but had hesitated to rent it, nervous about having a stranger in her home. The university’s safeguards reassured her. “My neighborhood is very beautiful,” she said, right up against the mountains, minutes from canyons and hiking, and half an hour from multiple ski resorts.

Even in expensive housing markets such as Washington, some students are finding solutions.

At American University, senior Henry Sprouse said he found an apartment near campus relatively easily, and is sharing the two-bedroom with two friends. He’ll pay $950 a month for his half of one bedroom.

Advertisement

His father Scott Sprouse said the process wasn’t as hard as he had worried it might be. Last year, his son’s rent for a 700-square-foot apartment was more than the mortgage payment for the family’s 3,400-square-foot house on an acre and a half just outside of Nashville, he said. “But when I looked at the market, it was a fair price. And when you get a roommate, that helps with that price.”

At Howard University, Cynthia Evers, vice president for student affairs, said they have seen increased demand for housing on campus this year, and have worked to make more beds available on and off-campus.

Last year, Jomi Ward helped organize efforts for fellow Howard University students struggling to find affordable apartments. This year, Ward is happy to be able to live on campus, where she applied to be a resident adviser.

“Senior year is my only opportunity to really live the on-campus-housing life, develop connections with other students, and enjoy college,” she said as she packed for the fall semester. “It’s my last hurrah.”

Meanwhile, in New York, NYU officials have seen heavier than usual demand for on-campus housing, and fewer cancellations, according to spokesman John Beckman.

Hubbard, who’s a student leader on campus, said NYU administrators have been very supportive and helpful and he’s grateful for that.

A program allowing students to donate unused meal “swipes” from their dining cards to help others eat was incredibly helpful, as well. “I literally survived off ‘Swipe it Forward,’” for lunches and dinner this past semester, he said.

He has kept a record, since sixth or seventh grade, of the requirements for admission to NYU. “It was always my dream,” he said. School officials are working with him to help keep him enrolled despite the costs, he said.

For now, with the school year starting in weeks, he’s still unsure of where he could live for senior year. But, he said, “things are looking hopeful.”

Imagine this: You’ve been heads down at work for several weeks when suddenly you hear a ping. You’ve received an email suggesting you’re overdue for a vacation and are presented a list of resorts in the very cities you want to visit. So you book a trip. When you arrive at your hotel, the staff knows your name. They know that you want an ocean view and extra towels, and that you’ll likely need a 9 a.m. wake-up call. They are aware that you need a gluten-free menu for room service and that you’ll want a late checkout. And you didn’t have to say a thing.

This is the type of personalization Sonia Cheng, chief executive of Rosewood Hotel Group, envisions for the future of the hotel industry with the help of data analytics. It’s one of the tech projects she’s spearheading at the private Hong Kong-based international hotel management chain, which operates more than 45 hotel in 16 countries including London, Paris, Beijing, Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.

We’re researching how automation and technology for the back office can simplify processes for our employees. However, in the hospitality industry, we’re still a people business. So there needs to be a balance between high tech and high touch. Ultimately, I think guests want to build that relationship with our associates, and that is something technology cannot replace.

Q: What learnings from the pandemic will you use in the future?

A: We have to remain flexible and nimble. The pandemic happened very quickly, and we reacted very quickly. We immediately implemented contactless check-in, hybrid meetings and [new processes for] how we work across the different geographies and understanding guests’ needs. For example, in a lot of cities, [people started taking] staycations. We were the first hotel brand to launch staycations in Hong Kong and transform Rosewood Hong Kong into an urban resort.

Evolving travel trends

Q: How have travel trends changed?

A: With business travel, because of the pandemic, customers are more willing to stay longer in [one place] so that they can connect with their colleagues. And because of all the technology that’s been built for online collaboration, you can work while you travel. So their vacations also tend to be longer because they are planning business meetings with their vacation time. Guests are also traveling with bigger groups and with family.

Q: What new trends have you seen from what guests want?

A: Customers are more focused on their well-being. And they are focused on how we can provide exclusivity. Some of these trends will stay post-pandemic. We’ve launched our new wellness brand, Aspire, to accommodate wellness. And we accelerated our plans to offer wellness classes online. At Rosewood Residences (the company’s apartment rental brand), we’re pushing out individual villas and exclusive accommodations. During the pandemic, everyone’s behavior online increased. So we’re looking at different e-commerce projects. Rosewood would be more than just a hotel brand. It would be a luxury lifestyle brand where we would offer different curated products.

Q: Has the pandemic altered any plans for expansion?

A: The business has been quite resilient. In 2021, we recorded the highest number of signings we’ve had at Rosewood Hotel Group. And just recently we’ve announced new projects that are going to join our portfolio, including in Raleigh, Miami, and Venice. Next year, we are on track to open Rosewood Amsterdam, Rosewood Munich, Kona Village in Hawaii as well as Rosewood Doha [in Qatar]. So the pace of opening hasn’t been challenged.

Evolution of hotel tech

Q: What has changed for guests and what is planned for the future?

A: Post-pandemic, it’s very important that we recognize our guests’ names and be able to anticipate guests’ needs. So we also are building a centralized system called a Data Lake House where we can anticipate needs based on guests’ profiles and customize their journey.

Q: What are the biggest tech priorities at Rosewood?

A: The Data Lake House is a big project that I think that will transform the way we develop our guests’ journeys. We can analyze data and travel patterns to anticipate what future Rosewood locations would be appropriate for our customers. [It should capture] your preferences during your stay, and [identify if] there’s a pattern on what type of rooms that you like to book.

Q: How have you created connection among a more distributed workforce?

A: The Insider app connects our associates around the world. We share company news and associates can post their photos, things that they think are interesting or stories or articles that they think are inspiring so that they can build community and get a sense of culture, particularly during the pandemic.

Q: How does Rosewood view emerging technologies like the metaverse?

A: NFTs and the metaverse — every company is looking at that space including us. It’s too early to tell. If we do anything, it needs to be something unique, differentiating and right for the brand. We need time to investigate it.

The fight for talent

Q: What are workers seeking from you as an employer?

A: They’re becoming quite selective in terms of the companies they choose. It’s very important for them to join a company that has a strong commitment in delivering positive impact and truly empowers associates. We are committed to ensure that there is strong diversity and that we’re supporting different groups. Talent right now really values organizations that have a strong sense of purpose. And they want to join a company that is not only doing well, but really doing good for the community.

Rosewood Hotel Group CEO Sonia Cheng says they have no rules limiting the number of day associates at their luxury hotels can work from home. (Video: The Washington Post)

Q: What is your biggest challenge?

A: The talent shortage is a challenge that everyone is facing. Being an attractive and performance-driven company for workers is important. So in addition to providing technology to ease the work, it’s important that we provide a strong career path. We built Rosewood Academy where we groom top talents and provide courses and programs for them.

Q: What should workers and guests expect from Rosewood in the future?

A: In five years’ time, you will see an organization that has very strong sense of purpose. With technology, we should be able to personalize our guest experiences. We have about 30 hotels in the pipeline so in five years, you’ll see our portfolio more than double.

39,How the Inflation Reduction Act might affect your health care,"If signed into law, the party’s long-stalled economic package would prevent huge spikes in the cost of health insurance for roughly 13 million Americans. It would limit seniors’ drugs costs at $2,000 a year. And it would place a cap of $35 a month on how much diabetics enrolled in Medicare would pay for insulin, a lifesaving medication.

Congressional Democrats are on the verge of passing their most significant health-care legislation in more than a decade , delivering a major victory to President Biden, who has made tackling the high price of care a key plank of his domestic agenda.

After more than a year of fraught negotiations, the economic package won the support of all Senate Democrats on Sunday, and heads to the House, where it’s expected to advance this week. The bill doesn’t make changes to the health-care system as sweeping as the party originally envisioned, and some policies will take years to be implemented.

40,"Abortion bans complicate access to drugs for cancer, arthritis, even ulcers","Listen 14 min Gift Article Share

Becky Hubbard, 46, has decided to get sterilized so that she can go back on the only medication that has relieved her disabling pain from rheumatoid arthritis for the last eight years. Soon after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the Tennessee woman said she got an ultimatum from her rheumatologist. If she wanted to stay on the treatment of choice for her condition, a drug called methotrexate, she was told she had to go on birth control despite her age and history of infertility.

“It is frustrating as hell,” said Hubbard, a former nurse who lives in Johnson City, Tenn., now waiting to see her gynecologist.

The sudden imposition of antiabortion laws after Roe’s reversal has left patients, doctors and pharmacists wading through a minefield of treatment issues and legal and ethical dilemmas related to women’s health care — even in situations like Hubbard’s that have nothing to do with pregnancy.

Medicines that treat conditions from cancer to autoimmune diseases to ulcers can also end a pregnancy or cause birth defects. As a result, doctors and pharmacists in more than a dozen states with strict abortion restrictions must suddenly navigate whether and when to order such drugs because they could be held criminally liable and lose their licenses for prescribing some of them to pregnant women.

Even if they can show their patients suffer from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, some doctors worry they could be prosecuted for prescribing such drugs to a patient with an unintended pregnancy. Such patients are also at greater risk because they can no longer seek abortions in their home states should they accidentally become pregnant while taking such drugs — no matter how grievous the injuries to the developing fetus.

“Methotrexate is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Traci Poole, a practicing pharmacist and faculty member at Belmont University College of Pharmacy in Nashville. “If you are of childbearing age, are you going to be denied medications that could potentially interfere with a pregnancy?”

There are no reliable estimates of how many women like Hubbard may have had their treatment regimens affected under the spate of new abortion bans. But some patient advocates say they have received dozens of reports from people encountering obstacles in the weeks since Roe’s reversal.

“We were surprised at the sheer number of complaints from people with arthritis and autoimmune conditions who were having problems filling prescriptions for methotrexate after the Dobbs decision,” said Steven Newmark, director of policy and chief legal officer for the Global Healthy Living Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of people with chronic diseases.

The group is now attempting to check those accounts, submitted through CreakyJoints, its digital forum for people with arthritis and their caregivers. Newmark said the group has also reached out to elected officials to try to clarify state policies — so far with no success. He said he would be surprised if even those with strong antiabortion views would not want to protect people living in pain.

“Trigger laws should not be impacting chronically ill patients in need of medication,” he said.

Doctors and pharmacists acknowledge being blindsided by the speed of the changes to state laws and say they are making changes to their practices to protect against liability. Major pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens, for instance, are instructing employees to make extra checks to validate that prescriptions will not be used to terminate pregnancies and delay filling them until their intended use is confirmed.

Civil rights and women’s advocates denounce many of these changes, questioning whether they may violate federal protections against discrimination on the basis of sex or disability. The issues are particularly disturbing, they say, since women are far more likely than men to have autoimmune diseases, and to be treated for conditions ranging from acne to anxiety and depression.

“We are seeing the spillover effects of Dobbs,” said Usha Ranji, associate director for women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy. “The impact is going to fall hard on women.”

Antiabortion activists, for their part, reject that view. They say they’re troubled by accounts like Hubbard’s because they never intended to restrict drugs like methotrexate to women with chronic health conditions.

Katie Glenn, state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an antiabortion advocacy group, said doctors and pharmacists should not have any concerns about prescribing those drugs to their patients, as long as they are not doing so to terminate a pregnancy.

“Intent is the key here,” Glenn said. “If you’re a rheumatologist, you’re not doing abortions. If you’ve never prescribed methotrexate for abortion, you’re free to continue prescribing it as you were.”

‘The gold standard’

For Hubbard, Roe’s reversal has been life-changing. Before Tennessee’s “heartbeat” ban blocked most abortions in the state, she said her doctors had no problem treating her with methotrexate even though she wasn’t taking birth control.

She and her husband have been unable to conceive for nearly two decades so the chance of her becoming pregnant in her late 40s seemed minuscule. She had taken birth control pills years ago, which she believes affected her health, so she is loath to try them again. She has similar worries about an IUD.

With Roe v. Wade overturned, the legality of abortion has been left to the states. Some worry that access to certain types of contraception could be next. (Video: Julie Yoon, Hadley Green, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)

But most of all, she hates the idea of going off methotrexate, an extraordinarily effective anti-inflammatory taken by nearly 60 percent of all rheumatoid arthritis patients, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.

“It is the gold standard for almost every rheumatological or autoimmune disease that affects the connective tissue, especially the joints,” said Fehmida Zahabi, a rheumatologist in the north Dallas area and president of the State of Texas Association of Rheumatologists.

The drug has gained notoriety for other uses as well. Methotrexate is specifically named in several abortion bans because at a higher dose, it has been used to induce abortions and also to end ectopic pregnancies when an embryo implants outside the uterus — a dire situation in which the fertilized egg cannot survive and must be removed to avoid life-threatening complications for the mother.

It can also lead to birth defects, and the potential of accidental pregnancies in places where abortion is banned has led some rheumatologists to reconsider prescribing the drug to women of childbearing age.

What Hubbard knows is that a treatment regimen featuring methotrexate enabled her to resume her life after her arthritis had become so crippling she had to stop working as a nurse. Although she began taking the medication in 2014, it has taken years of trial and error to find the right combination and dosages of drugs to keep the disease from progressing. While she still can’t work full time, she said she sells crafts that she makes at home and is able to spend more time with her adopted 14-year-old son.

She said she fears that without methotrexate, her pain would take over her life again. “If you can’t get the medicine that gets you out of the flares, you just have to live with the pain,” Hubbard said. “It’s awful.”

Newmark, the patient advocate, noted that the difference between taking medication and not for those with severe rheumatoid arthritis “is the difference between living normally and writhing in pain in bed.” Switching to another treatment is not simple, either, he added, because patients often spend years experimenting to find the right combination of drugs to keep their diseases in check.

Hubbard’s doctor declined to comment for this story, saying he could not discuss an individual patient’s treatment.

Most medical groups say they are sympathetic to the plight of such patients and looking to see what steps they might take to protect them.

“Physicians have been placed in an impossible situation — trying to meet their ethical duties to place patient health and well-being first, while attempting to comply with vague, restrictive, complex, and conflicting state laws that interfere in the practice of medicine and jeopardize the health of patients,” Jack Resneck Jr., president of the American Medical Association, told federal lawmakers on July 19.

The American College of Rheumatology assembled a task force last month to try to assess the scope of the problem, said Kenneth Saag, the group’s president. “There is concern … that one of the unintended consequences is that patients are going to have reduced access to this medicine and other medicines,” he said.

Physicians are also worried about their potential liability from antiabortion laws that took effect virtually overnight in some states following the high court’s decision, said Saag, director of the division of clinical rheumatology the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

They’re also concerned about the ramifications of accidental pregnancies. While doctors prescribing drugs such as methotrexate routinely talk to their patients about the importance of birth control, he said, unintended pregnancies occur, posing distressing questions for doctors and patients.

“Some women have elected historically to consider pregnancy termination” in such situations, he said. “In some places, that may no longer be an option.”

Anxious patients

As doctors balance their liability against their patients’ needs and medical standards of care, women who depend on such drugs say they feel frightened and anxious about whether they will be able to obtain their next refill.

Claire Eby, who lives near Austin, has taken methotrexate since she was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis at age 4. When she was 18, her doctors tried to wean her off the drug, believing she was going into remission.

“Things went down south really fast,” said Eby, now 26. She developed inflammation in her eyes, which led to cataracts. The medicine that stopped her eyes from deteriorating further was methotrexate.

“Your health can deteriorate rapidly and also permanently,” if you stop taking methotrexate, Eby said. “My vision damage was permanent.”

Eby said she takes birth control, but her doctors also recently added a pregnancy test to the routine lab work she has to undergo every three months to stay on the medication — a change that coincided with Texas’s increasingly strict abortion restrictions.

“They hadn’t done that before,” Eby said.

Doctors usually recommend against stopping methotrexate without being weaned off slowly, and some patients worry that getting cut off from the drug when they go to get a refill could be dangerous.

“It’s not safe to just cold-turkey stop,” said lupus patient Becky Schwartz, 27, who lives in Tysons, Va.

She said the firm that owns her rheumatologist’s practice put a temporary pause on methotrexate prescriptions in July as it evaluates the laws that took effect after the Supreme Court’s decision, although Virginia has not imposed new abortion restrictions.

Schwartz said she is grateful that she had just refilled her prescription before the new policy took effect, and she and her doctor came up with an emergency plan to wean her off the drug safely.

But the date her prescription runs out looms big. “I will have no meds left come September,” she said.

Since the Supreme Court’s decision, pharmacists, who have liability for prescriptions they dispense, also have been scrambling to figure out how to respond.

At least one of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains has told their pharmacists in states with abortion bans to ask for diagnosis codes before dispensing drugs like methotrexate and misoprostol, which is used to complete miscarriages as well as for abortions. “We’re committed to supporting women’s health care,” said Mike DeAngelis, CVS’s executive director for corporate communications. But he added, “These laws, some of which include criminal penalties, have forced us to require pharmacists in these states to validate that the intended indication is not to terminate a pregnancy.”

A spokesman for Walgreens said that national pharmacy chain is also taking trigger laws into consideration when filling prescriptions for drugs that may be used to terminate a pregnancy. “In these states, our pharmacists work closely with prescribers as needed, to fill lawful, clinically appropriate prescriptions,” Fraser Engerman, a company spokesman, said in an email.

Such policy changes may be subject to challenge under federal civil rights law, however, because they potentially target people on the basis of sex and disability, argued Matthew Cortland, a senior fellow at Data for Progress, a think tank dedicated to advancing liberal causes, who shared a CVS memo on Twitter.

Some doctors also object to pharmacies requiring diagnosis codes for drugs like methotrexate, saying that a forgotten code may lead to delays filling prescriptions for patients with debilitating pain.

“It becomes a huge problem if we see [a] patient on Thursday or Friday and we don’t get the pharmacy to call back” immediately, said Zahabi, the Dallas-based rheumatologist. “The patient can’t get treatment for three or four days, which can be agonizing.”

But Poole dismissed such concerns, saying pharmacists have advocated for years for the use of such codes in the interest of patient safety; many medical offices already provide them on electronic prescriptions.

Elisa Greene, associate professor of pharmacy practice at Belmont University College of Pharmacy, noted that prescribing and filling prescriptions for drugs that can cause birth defects is not a new issue. She contrasted the lack of guidance to doctors and pharmacists handling prescriptions like methotrexate with the tight regimen required by the FDA for those prescribing or dispensing Accutane — an acne treatment that can cause birth defects.

Doctors and pharmacists, along with their patients regardless of age or gender, are required to enroll in an education program about the drug’s potential dangers, she said. And female patients of childbearing age must have negative pregnancy test results before a prescription is filled.

“That requirement … is not in place for methotrexate,” Greene wrote in a text message.

Living in pain

For patients like Hubbard, the concerns are more immediate. She has gone without methotrexate injections for several weeks now, while waiting to see a gynecologist about having a tubal ligation that will prevent her from ever getting pregnant.

A week ago, she fell down during her son’s birthday celebration because of the pain in her joints. “Things have definitely gotten worse,” she said. “My joints aren’t doing as well.”

Hubbard said she wishes she had the foresight to anticipate that Tennessee’s fetal heartbeat law, which took effect the day after Roe’s reversal, would have such a big effect on her own life.

“I knew there would be other things [than abortion] affected,” she said. “Never in my life did I think it would be my rheumatoid arthritis medicine.”

41,"After passage of climate bill, long road awaits","Listen 12 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

In some ways, it’s a peculiar time for Congress to be heaping tax credits onto the electric vehicle industry. Sales of electric vehicles are skyrocketing and recently hit record highs, according to Cox Automotive. General Motors, which lost access to the old U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles three years ago, has sold 70,000 plug-ins since then despite a public relations disaster involving burning batteries. Pricier Tesla has reached an annual pace of nearly 1 million car sales worldwide. And multiyear back orders have piled up for electric versions of GM’s Hummer, Volkswagen’s updated minivan and Ford’s Mustang among others.

Despite that robust business, the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Senate approved Sunday and is likely to be passed into law by the end of the week, will pump $36 billion to incentivize more electric car purchases over the next decade. It’s part of $369 billion in the bill for tax subsidies and other measures designed to speed up the clean energy transition.

A wide range of economists and energy and climate experts agree the money will be a powerful tool to reduce carbon emissions and transition America’s economy to one that contributes much less to global warming. Yet even if the federal money becomes available, a lot else will have to come to pass to make the investment pay off.

An entire supply chain of rare minerals, semiconductors, batteries and financing has to fall into place before Americans give up their combustion engines. American consumers can only claim the full $7,500 credit for an all-electric engine if their manufacturers displace Chinese batteries by 2024 and minerals from China or other countries lacking free-trade agreements by 2025 — a threshold that automakers are warning could be impossible to meet. And China, furious right now over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to Taiwan, will be watching as the United States openly strives to liberate itself from manufacturing in the People’s Republic.

Nonfinancial barriers — such as local opposition to building wind and solar farms or a lack of transmission lines — must be overcome. And with roughly 40 tax credits in the legislation, some of those aimed at transforming the energy economy from automobiles to wind turbines to heat pumps will inevitably miss the mark. Some portion of those funds will be pocketed when they aren’t entirely needed — many companies have promised to transition to clean energy irrespective of federal policy.

And some money will go to projects that never materialize or fail altogether. The 2009 stimulus bill, the largest investment in clean energy before the new bill, created a clean energy loan program that infamously funded the failed solar start-up Solyndra, which became an embarrassment for the Obama administration. And it poured billions of dollars into a high-speed-rail system in California that has still not come to fruition.

“It’s very hard to try to target incentives to activities that wouldn’t otherwise happen,” said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economics professor and chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. “Some dollars are wasted, but that’s the nature of government subsidies.”

Proponents argue that the money in the bill will help overcome these many potential obstacles.

“The tax incentives are good because we know that they work,” said Matt Casale, director of environmental campaigns at U.S. PIRG, a public interest group. “They do a good job of moving that investment forward and leveraging that investment.”

The electric vehicle benefits are a good illustration of these dynamics. Existing tax law provides $7,500 tax credits for each of the 200,000 electric vehicles made by an individual manufacturer. After that, the credits are phased out for that manufacturer over the course of a year. If GM’s customers since April 2019 got the full tax credit, they would have received $200 million to $300 million for doing something they did anyway.

But the Inflation Reduction Act would sweeten the pot, with the government extending the full $7,500 tax credit through 2032 while scrapping the 200,000 unit ceiling, which has already affected Tesla, GM and Toyota. For more modest income earners, the tax credit will be refundable, meaning that regardless of the buyer’s income, the purchase price reflects the full tax credit. That won’t matter for buying Teslas, which generally sell in the $65,000 range, but GM is offering the Bolt for less than $30,000.

GM and other major carmakers say they have ambitious plans for increasing electric vehicle sales, plans that are essential if the United States is to meet its climate change targets. Bolt’s 2021 sales number set a record, but it still came to a measly 24,827 — about a seventh of 1 percent of all the cars sold in the United States last year.

Looking to 2030, by comparison, GM is investing $15.7 billion to convert much of its entire fleet to electric vehicles — and it’s counting on Congress for a boost.

“The reason why these types of policies are so important is because it is an accelerator of EV adoption,” said Matt Ybarra, a GM spokesman.

The Inflation Reduction Act would cover a much broader array of projects than simply EVs. One of the bigger items in the bill, a $44 billion production tax credit, would promote wind, solar, battery storage and hydrogen technologies. Other credits totaling about $9 billion would spur the installation of efficient heat pumps and electric stoves. Credits that have been extended every two years will now last a decade, increasing certainty about the future.

In a number of cases, the Inflation Reduction Act aims to accelerate efforts already underway.

For example, the bill demands that the oil and gas industry either capture leaks of methane, a very harmful greenhouse gas, or pay a hefty fee for failing to do so. But much of the industry has already agreed to abide by proposed regulations clamping down on methane leaks.

The legislation also could accelerate investments in massive renewable energy projects that major energy companies are already pursuing. Production tax credits worth about $30 billion are designed to accelerate U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing. The investment tax credit would provide $10 billion more to build clean technology manufacturing facilities.

Even as energy giants BP and Shell continue to drill for oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, they along with Equinor, another major energy firm, are among the companies now funding the construction of wind turbines in waters off New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York.

“I have one client looking at Texas and New Mexico. Having this extension will help them make that decision, and they will be able to pull the trigger,” said Devin Hall, a tax partner at the public accounting, consulting and technology firm Crowe dealing with big energy companies.

Yet even with this new federal support, other barriers might stand in the way.

Off the Atlantic coast in the New York area, developers must deal with “local opposition from certain communities and fishing groups, the need for interconnection and transmission upgrades, and the usual array of commercial, technical, legal, and financial hurdles that accompany billion-dollar infrastructure projects, particularly those that involve installation of towers the size of a Manhattan skyscraper at sea,” Carl Valenstein and Jonathan Wilcon, lawyers at Morgan Lewis, wrote in an analysis in December.

The pair said that under the Jones Act, only U.S. ships can be used for trade within U.S. borders, making it difficult to tap more advanced European vessels.

The oil and gas industry is also interested in other provisions, especially the generous tax provision for projects that would capture carbon — and store or use it. The tax credit would provide $85 a ton for burying the carbon dioxide underground, $60 a ton for utilization or injection for enhanced oil recovery, and $180 a ton for capturing directly from the air.

The act would also bestow $30 billion to the nuclear industry by providing tax credits to the owners of existing reactors — not to incentivize them to do something but to just stop them from closing down, as many have threatened to do. The United States has 92 reactors, but seven have closed in the past decade, according to the Energy Information Administration.

“We continue to review the provisions, but a significant and positive impact of the act will be the production tax credit for nuclear that would help preserve the long-term operation of New Jersey’s and our nation’s largest source of carbon-free power generation,” said Marijke Shugrue, spokeswoman for PSEG, a large New Jersey-based utility that operates two nuclear generating stations in New Jersey and is part-owner of another in Pennsylvania.

The new legislation would also establish a federal “green bank” with $27 billion to use for loans to energy-related projects, including solar, wind, battery storage and much more. That money could be leveraged three to four times, extending its influence to $75 billion to $100 billion of projects.

Not all of those work out. A $535 million loan to Solyndra was lost after the solar panel company went bankrupt, one of a handful that failed, prompting intense scrutiny from Congress. But overall the Energy Department under President Barack Obama received far more in interest payments than the sum lost by those failures.

On balance, while private capital has already been flowing into clean energy projects, many projects have been unable to nail down financing, said Reed Hundt, co-chair of the Coalition for Green Capital, whose network of 20 state and local green banks has an unfunded backlog of $21 billion.

Those include scores upon scores of projects, including a new public bus fleet in the Washington, D.C., area; geothermal projects to help lithium extraction in the Salton Sea; efficient affordable housing in Texas; and $20 million to replace and electrify the heating systems in 924 units of a World War II-era housing development in Connecticut near an immigrant community that was rezoned.

“Investment is moving in this direction,” said Jeffrey Schub, the former executive director of the Coalition for Green Capital. “If time wasn’t of the essence, we wouldn’t need a green bank. But we need to speed up the clock. It’s a question of putting our foot on the gas and moving more money in this direction.”

The geothermal firm Dandelion Energy is also eager for the reconciliation bill to be adopted.

“It’s going to benefit us — a lot,” said Michael Sachse, Dandelion’s chief executive, who has been in talks with Lennar, the nation’s second-largest home builder and an investor in Dandelion. “Suddenly all the math makes sense.”

The legislation would increase the amount of tax credits for geothermal investors and it would extend the time period to 10 years, similar to credits available for solar projects. A home builder or other investor can pay for the geothermal system and lease it back to home buyers, who will end up paying a fixed fee that would be less than they would have paid for air conditioning.

Sachse said Dandelion has installed geothermal in about 600 homes this year and plans to double the pace next year.

But even with tax credits, transforming the U.S. economy and bringing climate change measures to millions of purchasing decisions isn’t so easy. Installing geothermal in existing homes can be difficult because drilling equipment is large and can’t squeeze in. Currently, geothermal provides less than 1 percent of U.S. energy capacity, the Energy Department said, and 90 percent of projects are in Nevada or California.

Matt Casale and his wife are logical customers for the sort of energy efficiency measures and tax breaks that lie at the heart of the proposed legislation. Through his work, Casale is an advocate for heat pumps, solar panels, electric vehicles and energy efficiency for buildings.

“I’ve been trying to do this with my own home,” Casale says. “We’re penciling out the numbers.” The kitchen was already electric when they moved in so buying a new electric stove was “an easy choice” and with an old roof, it seems like the right time to replace it and install solar panels.

The furnace, while old, is not broken. “We’re expecting it to go in the next two years, so we’re planning to go in for a heat pump then,” Casale said. That will cost them anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 — without the new federal tax credits. That is still “a big purchase,” Casale said, and “one of the challenges for people, is that it’s a system you don’t replace often.”

For rooftop solar, they’ve received estimates around $40,000. “Our roof is pretty old,” he said. “Those financials look to be penciling out nicely.”

But after all of those investments, Casale plans on waiting a few years before switching to an electric vehicle and getting a charging plug at home. “So, we’re not yet all electric, but we’ve made a road map for how to get there,” he said.

What do you do when life hands you a mind-bendingly humiliating and emotional trauma involving yourself, your father and the internet? You make a movie about it. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “I Love My Dad” premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March and won both the jury prize and the audience award for best narrative feature — pretty remarkable for a movie most audiences watch through their fingers while screaming in embarrassment. The second feature film from writer-director-star James Morosini (“Threesomething”), it’s an ink-black comedy about Franklin, a brooding young man played by the filmmaker, who has cut off all communication with his unreliable screw-up of a father, Chuck, played by actor-comedian Patton Oswalt. Desperate to connect, the father creates a fake Facebook account and, under the guise of Becca (Claudia Sulewski), a willowy and sympathetic woman Franklin’s age, establishes a relationship with his son that can’t help veering into oh-no-they-didn’t/oh-my-god-they-did territory.

It sounds like a tabloid headline or the title of a particularly unseemly Subreddit: I Got Catfished By My Own Father. Yet “I Love My Dad,” which opened in theaters Friday and whose title points in at least two directions, is more than just a one-joke cringefest. On the contrary, it goes to some honest and movingly real places in the eternal struggle between parent and child — while simultaneously making you want to rinse your eyeballs with lye.

Worst of all? (Or best, depending on how much you’re into schadenfreude.) This really happened to James Morosini. Speaking recently by Zoom from his home in Los Angeles, the lanky filmmaking triple threat, 32, ’fesses up. “When I was around 20 years old, I got in a big fight with my dad and I decided in kind of 20-year-old fashion that I was going to cut him out, that I was done with him. Blocked him on Facebook, changed his name in my phone to Do Not Answer. And I got home one day and this really pretty girl sent me a friend request on Facebook, and she had all the same interests as me and all these great pictures. I got really excited, and I started to feel kind of better about myself. My self-esteem started to improve. And then I found out that it was my dad, and he created this thing as a way of making sure I was okay.”

And how long did the deception last? “Longer than I wish it had, I’ll say.”

At the same time, Morosini says the social media disaster led to an odd sort of reckoning between father and son. “It forced our relationship to hit this rock bottom that allowed an experience of honesty to start being more important in our relationship. And that’s what the film is about in a lot of ways. How are we honest in our relationships? And what does it mean to be closer to somebody if you’re getting closer to them in a dishonest way?”

“I Love My Dad” has broken the filmmaker out of his generational cohort of young Hollywood guys, all writing and acting and putting weird comedy shorts on the internet while hoping for their big break. Morosini grew up shooting little action videos in the Boston suburbs — “kids with boxing gloves on, that don’t know how to fight, trying to punch each other” — and, after graduating from the University of Southern California’s School of Dramatic Arts, tried to make it as an actor, finding some success (“American Horror Story” on FX, “The Sex Lives of College Girls” on HBO Max) and little fulfillment.

“I was often cast as a bro or, like, the dumb guy,” he says. “I was making a decent living, but I wasn’t necessarily that fulfilled creatively. So I was spending a lot of time writing features and making web series and watching an obsessive amount of film. I would go down, like, the AFI Top 100. I would go down Sight & Sound’s Top 100. I would go country by country. I spent a lot of time with Éric Rohmer and became really obsessed with Michael Haneke.”

That eclecticism reflects the movies Morosini likes and the movies he wants to make. “I admire a big-budget Hollywood film,” he says, “but then I also love the more personal indies. And I think my intent is to try and combine those sensibilities. My dream is to make big-budget spectacle films that have a certain weirdness to them, that have almost a taboo embedded in them in some way or another.”

With “I Love My Dad,” he has nailed the taboo part. The scenes in which a lovestruck Franklin wants to get, uh, intimate with his new internet girlfriend while Chuck, on the other side of the phone, frantically tries to backpedal and then improvise, are horrifyingly hilarious or hilariously horrifying, especially when seen with an audience in full vocal mortification.

“That’s part of the mischievous delight of the film, watching everybody freak out while they’re watching it,” the director admits. “And I think that was my intent making it, to take people through that roller coaster, where some parts are really sarcastic and then there are parts that are really sincere, and the audience has to be on their toes the whole time.”

He has special praise for his co-star, who commits to the role of Chuck with a fearlessness that evokes a kind of squeamish awe. “Patton is able to bring levity to darkness and he’s also able to work with tone, where he’s able to shift gears and go from light to dark and dark to light,” Morosini says. “And he approaches all this work with a great sense of humanity.”

Oswalt, reached by email while in San Diego for Comic-Con, said of working with Morosini: “He gave me something great to play against, in that in a lot of our scenes you see he doesn’t give me anything, because those are the walls the son has put up around his father. My trying to break through those walls created this terrific tension and led to some real emotion [and human comedy].”

When asked what he sees in Morosini’s future, Oswalt responded: “I have no idea where he’s headed. He’s gonna zig and zag like the great early ’70s directors. Sidney Lumet went from ‘Serpico’ to ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ to ‘Dog Day Afternoon’ to ‘Network.’ The directors that are true searchers never try to carve out a niche. They try to expand the canvas.”

Morosini embraces that search. “I feel like I have a very particular thing I’m chasing, and I can’t even quite articulate it,” he says. “But I know that ‘I Love My Dad’ is a step of that journey.”

Before that next step, though, the world wants to know: What did Morosini’s father think about the movie? “I was nervous for him to see it,” the filmmaker says, “but he loves it and he’s in on the joke and is able to laugh at himself. And, I don’t know, that’s how I try to process things in my own life. How can I laugh at them and realize that in the grand scheme of things you can laugh at anything?”

One answer is to get an audience to laugh — and feel — along with you.

43,Carolyn Hax: Is dating a never-married man a waste of time?,"Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Carolyn Hax is away. The following is from March 9, 2008. Dear Carolyn: I’m a 44-year-old divorced woman looking for a committed relationship, and I want to get remarried. I’ve had a few fun dates with a 48-year-old never-married man. We’ve not yet talked about previous relationships or goals in our relationship. We’ve all been warned to be leery of never-married men; it’s likely that they never will get married, right? What are your thoughts on the matter? As I move forward in the relationship, what are some questions I might ask of him to learn whether he is truly open to commitment or whether I’m wasting my time?

— D.

D.: The never-marrieds are a bad risk because they will never commit, yes, I’ve heard that.

Remember, too, that divorced people will commit — but then they’ll bolt.

And, of course, widows and widowers will always remain devoted, on some level, to the departed, whom you can never hope to replace.

Advertisement

I hardly need mention the ones who are dating you while they’re still married, but I will anyway: You can never trust them not to cheat on you the way they did on your predecessor.

I’m not sure if the spouses of alien abductees are considered married or a category all their own, but, either way, they’ll just be up all night checking the foil on the roof.

And don’t get me started on the marriage-or-bust crew.

By my count, that just about rules out dating another human being.

If you’re at peace with the idea that a certain level of risk is inevitable, though, then there are arguments to be made for and against just about anyone in any of these categories. That’s why the most important questions you can ask this man are the ones that help you get to know the one you’re dating, as a person (as opposed to a spouse-by-numbers). Find out who he is, what he stands for and whether you’d ever commit to him.

Dear Carolyn: This is a twist on a common problem:

My new boyfriend makes more money than I do. We take turns paying when we go out. Unfortunately, he has expensive tastes. I tend to order frugally; he orders basically the priciest things on the menu.

We’ve discussed our income disparity before and resolved to eat out less. But when we do go out, again, it’s always something that costs twice as much as what I ordered! I feel like a mean-spirited, nitpicky cheapskate heel for being annoyed, but I have serious money problems as it is, and I’m very stressed out about them.

So how do I say, “Baby, get a burger, not the filet mignon, because I’m gonna get evicted otherwise”?

— Washington

Washington: Common problem, but there is no twist: You need to learn to say no.

It’s not a matter of the words; your burger line is just fine, and you could also suggest splitting things equitably. Though I would argue that you need to speak up even sooner than that, and offer dately reciprocation by cooking and not dining out.

The real issue is your ability to say the words.

This is your money he’s spending, to the detriment of your financial and emotional health, and, because you won’t stand up for yourself, he’s doing it with your permission. Find your spine, and use it.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)

Listen 15 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The Washington region is growing — a metropolis of nearly 6 million people where area officials are pressing to build another 320,000 homes by the end of this decade. And with that growth comes an increasing, largely unregulated problem: Salt. Lots of it. Paved streets, sidewalks and parking lots need de-icing in winter, with the sodium chloride in road salt running off into streams. Washing machines drain sodium-containing detergents and industrial firms discharge sodium-laden water into wastewater systems, which already treat the human waste of a society addicted to salty foods and drinks.

All these sources contribute to what environmental scientists refer to as a “freshwater salinization syndrome” that is damaging local waterways, harming wildlife and affecting the quality of drinking water throughout the United States — posing risks to people who are sensitive to the two elements in salt: sodium and chloride.

While drinking water quality remains safe for most people now, the compounding effects of a mineral that has been so central to daily life are accelerating and may become irreversible, researchers say.

That’s particularly so in urban areas like metropolitan D.C., studies on the problem show.

Water utilities, warily monitoring the problem, say they may need to invest several hundred million dollars in new desalinization plants to reverse the trend.

“Salt is probably the most serious problem in world history related to water,” said Sujay Kaushal, a University of Maryland biogeochemist, adding that the damaging effects on streams and aquatic life are early red flags to a predicament that could eventually consume the region.

He compared the cumulative effects on the region’s watersheds to the hardening arteries of someone with a high-salt diet.

“Eventually, we know, in the human body, that when you harden the arteries, you create hypertension and all these health problems,” Kaushal said. “It’s the same in the environment. You start crossing these thresholds where you see all these environmental impacts.”

Soap bubbles gathered on the surface of the orange-and-black tinted water flowing from a storm drain pipe into Campus Creek behind the University of Maryland’s College Park campus.

“You see how the water changes color there?” Kaushal asked, pointing to an orange plume.

The colors came from iron and manganese, among the metals that have been entering streams from the pipes and soil with more frequency in recent years — an effect of salt corrosion. And the bubbles, entering through an apparent sewer line leak, were from sodium-containing laundry or dishwasher detergent — a major contributor to the region’s salt problem.

Kaushal passed a feathery thicket of invasive salt-resistant reeds and hiked down to the eroded stream bank as a crew of students who’ve been measuring salinity in streams across the region prepared to test for electrical conductivity, a gauge of how many charged salt ions are in the water.

Some days, when it’s dry, the tests show conductivity comparable to Gatorade, 450 milligrams of sodium per liter. On others, it climbs to the level of a cup of instant ramen, 1,820 milligrams of sodium per liter.

Kaushal, 47, has been sounding alarms about the rising concentrations of salt in the water for nearly 20 years.

His research papers have shown higher levels of salt in streams in urban areas, where roads and parking lots act as funnels for storm runoff into streams.

The studies have shown how human waste is also an increasing contributor. The sodium and chloride it contains passes through water treatment plants — along with the salts in water softeners, lawn-care products and detergents.

And they’ve detailed how salt ions strip away metals inside those pipes and in stream soils, creating “chemical cocktails” that — along with the salt itself — can kill plant life, insects and stream invertebrates, driving away the fish that consume them.

Last September, Kaushal and his team produced another paper finding that freshwater salinization syndrome has begun to undermine the effectiveness of multimillion-dollar stream restoration projects to reduce the flow of pollutants entering the Chesapeake Bay.

With finding after finding, Kaushal has been like a protagonist in an ecological disaster film, unable to get enough people to listen while the signs of a looming crisis surface everywhere, including in his own Chevy Chase neighborhood in 2015, when brownish manganese-enriched water started flowing.

The invasion of salt on freshwater sources “has led to ancient civilizations collapsing,” he said, citing the downfall of Mesopotamia nearly 4,000 years ago. “It affects our food, our drinking water, our air, even.”

Once algae-pocked emblems of water pollution during the early 1970s, the Potomac River and the Occoquan Reservoir — the two sources of drinking water used by Fairfax Water to serve more than 2 million customers in Northern Virginia — are now trending in the wrong direction on salt, while the other contaminants have largely been cleaned up.

The concentrations of sodium in Potomac water drawn in Loudoun County have crept up from about 10 milligrams per liter in 1996 to nearly 16 milligrams per liter this year, with occasional spikes above the Environmental Protection Agency’s advisory level of 20 milligrams for people with high blood pressure.

In the reservoir, sodium concentrations are now consistently above that threshold and, on some days, above the 60 milligrams per liter mark the EPA says is the high threshold at which some people notice a taste difference in the water, according to Virginia Tech’s Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Laboratory.

Concentrations of chloride — which can be toxic to aquatic life and, in high doses, cause high blood pressure and kidney problems in humans — have also trended upward in both waterways.

The EPA does not have standards regulating sodium in drinking water or streams. For aquatic life, the federal water quality standard for consistent levels of chloride is 230 milligrams per liter.

So far, none of the region’s drinking water sources have exceeded that level, though area streams and rivers often show amounts that are far higher when road salt is used during the winter, researchers say.

The trends may be “the canary in the coal mine” indicating the approach of a more worrisome “tipping point,” said Stanley Grant, director of the Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Laboratory.

Beyond that irreversible mark “is a really bad point to start planning,” said Grant, whose lab has been studying pollution in the reservoir for 50 years.

“It’s not that the sodium levels, for example, that are currently in the reservoir are particularly problematic,” Grant said. “It’s the fact that you see that trend upward.”

For the most part, efforts to raise public awareness have focused on reducing the amount of salt-based de-icers used on roads during cold weather, a step already taken by public works departments responsible for road upkeep.

Area officials are also urging neighborhood associations and businesses — who are wary about being sued if someone slips on ice on their property — to use salt judiciously.

Fairfax County issues corrective action notices, with as much as $32,500 in penalties if the recipient is a repeat offender. Since that effort began in 2019, the county has doled out 52 such notices, though nobody has been fined, county officials said.

“We’re putting down a little too much because we’re being overcautious,” said Martin Hurd, a Fairfax County environmental protection specialist. “People don’t really make the connection that it has these downstream effects.”

Residents gathered at a recent Prince William County Board meeting, eager to share their anger over plans to convert farmland in the Gainesville area into 2,100 acres of computer data centers. Most of them live in Heritage Hunt, a 1,863-home neighborhood near the site that was also once farmland and is now a significant contributor of salt to the Occoquan watershed. They and environmental groups have seized on the argument that new data centers — and roads and parking lots — would have devastating impacts to the watershed by adding urban runoff to the slice of protected agricultural land known as the “Rural Crescent.”

Many data centers also use water to keep their machines cool, producing sodium-enriched wastewater that flows into sewers, though the industry has been shifting toward more eco-friendly cooling systems.

“Why jeopardize the environmental balance it provides to the watershed of Northern Virginia?” Chuck Zumbaugh, one resident, told the county board at the meeting.

The proposal is part of an ongoing assessment of the overall land use plan in Virginia’s second-largest county as it seeks to accommodate more growth and, in the process, become a major economic hub in the Washington region. The $8.4 billion data center industry is one route to that goal, considered easy money as far as tax revenue goes, given that the mammoth structures require few county services and the 33 data centers already in the county contribute $79 million to the annual budget.

Fairfax Water has been monitoring those discussions, sending a letter to the county in May that urged officials to incorporate “a rigorous evaluation of the potential impacts” to the Occoquan watershed.

It’s part of an evolving watchdog role the water utility has taken on as the rural buffer zone around the reservoir — itself lined by homes with commanding views of the water — steadily disappears.

The rapid growth of the tech industry in the region factors into that role more frequently.

In 2019, Fairfax Water saw a surge in sodium entering the reservoir from one source: Micron Technologies, Inc., a global computer chip manufacturer whose $3 billion expansion of its plant in Manassas is expected to generate 1,100 high-skilled jobs by 2030.

Micron, which uses sodium while washing its chips, discharges 2.3 million gallons of wastewater per day, accounting for 14 percent of the sodium in the treated water entering the reservoir. As part of the expansion, Micron plans to increase that amount by 70 percent.

Fairfax Water discovered that the concentrations of sodium in Micron’s output had also jumped, to 140 milligrams per liter from 100 milligrams per liter, which itself was nearly 40 percent higher than years before.

The tech company initially ignored the utility’s requests to reduce its sodium discharge, angering Fairfax Water board members and employees, according to a recording of a 2019 board meeting.

“Our customers are going to taste this if we don’t do something now,” a Fairfax Water employee told the board during the meeting.

After some back and forth — including a complicated proposal to allow Micron to continue at the higher levels during rainier weather — the company agreed to return to 100 milligrams per liter. That took effect in October, a Micron spokeswoman said.

Though resolved, the episode illustrates the various economic pressures now placed on drinking water sources in the region, said Phil Allin, chair of Fairfax Water’s board.

“It’s a valuable resource and it’s something that we can’t screw up,” he said about the reservoir.

But the demand for more development is pressing.

And it’s not just new industry. Like the rest of the Washington region, Prince William is trying to cultivate more affordable housing. A shift toward larger suburban homes with more space prompted by the coronavirus drove up prices in an already expensive housing market. In the spring, inflation further drove up prices, leaving many homes out of reach to thousands of lower-to-middle-income families.

Several supervisors on Prince William’s Democratic controlled board see the 117,000-acre Rural Crescent as a logical place to put some new homes and businesses — including, possibly, data centers — after other, more densely populated areas of Prince William have been built out.

“At the end of the day, we’re going to build more homes, and I’m pretty sure it’s going to create these salt runoffs,” Supervisor Victor S. Angry (D-Neabsco) said near the end of the meeting.

“On the other hand, I have folks who deserve a slice of their paradise, their own home, in these locations,” he said. “And we’re going to do that. It’s a tough decision.”

Bulldozers rumbled at the construction site of a development in Fairfax City that, along with 50 townhouses, will feature a 200-unit senior living facility, part of a separate demand for housing as the region’s elderly population continues to grow.

About 50 yards away, an eroding sliver of Accotink Creek was covered by algae blooms and other signs of urban runoff as a few tiny minnows darted past where a culvert will cover the stream as part of the development.

The creek and its surrounding Accotink watershed, which has lost a significant portion of the insects and invertebrates that are fundamental to healthy waterways, is the only one in the Washington region that is being regulated for particles found in winter salt, specifically chloride.

Advertisement

The success of that effort — which focuses on best practices for handling road salt, in part through requirements linked to storm sewer system permits — could be a guide for future regulation of streams.

Researchers argue that the need for more regulation is becoming urgent, though they acknowledge that it could be costly for local agencies and complicated in urban areas that have competing needs surrounding economic development and social equity.

“It’s a wicked problem, man, because you’ve got all these different factors coming into play,” said Grant, whose lab is embarking on federally funded research that, in part, will look at how much sodium in drinking water people can live with — data that will inform discussions on ways to change consumer behavior with respect to salt.

More research is needed to better determine how much of an impact the salt is having, said Will Isenberg, a specialist focusing on watershed and ecology issues at the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.

“Something that we and other states have been requesting of the EPA is to raise the priority of freshwater salinization so that we can have that kind of information,” he said. “If it’s determined that a water quality standard is necessary for whatever ion, then we can weave that into our regulatory programs.”

An EPA spokesperson said the agency is in the process of updating its aquatic life criteria for chloride, informed by the latest research on salt ions.

With the Accotink, Virginia’s DEQ decided to create a “total maximum daily load,” or TMDL, limit for chloride after a federal judge ruled in a 2012 lawsuit against an EPA effort to regulate for the flow of urban runoff damaging streams.

Fairfax County and the Virginia Department of Transportation — who both sued the EPA over the issue — argued it would be unreasonably expensive and impractical to try to control the flow of storm water.

After years of study and community dialogues over the chloride TMDL, it is just beginning to be implemented, DEQ officials said.

Chloride levels in the creek range from minimal amounts at some sites to as many as 2,500 milligrams per liter in others, according to data provided by DEQ.

Whether a TMDL for chloride or any other salt ion will be created for other streams with rising salinity depends on how well those bottom-dwelling insects, worms and mollusks fare, which could take several years to know, environmental officials and groups addressing the problem say.

“It’s a problem that has been a long time in the making, so it’s going to take a long time to turn around,” said Steven Bieber, who oversees the water quality program at MWCOG. “And a lot of effort to turn it around.”

In the meantime, the signs of mounting stress to stream life continue.

Katy Johnson recalled how, in the portion of the creek behind her Fairfax City home, the song of Cope’s Gray Tree Frogs — dependent on aquatic life in the stream — once filled the night every summer.

The frogs, sensitive to salt, are gone now, said Johnson, a volunteer with the Friends of Accotink Creek restoration group.

“I really miss those frogs,” she said.

45,"Multi-fatality lightning strikes are rare, but most have this in common","Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The lightning strike that killed three tourists and critically wounded a D.C. resident Thursday was unusual not just because lightning fatalities have become increasingly rare in the United States, but because a single strike rarely kills more than two people. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight In fact, it had been nearly 20 years since three people were killed by a single lightning bolt, according to data from the National Lightning Safety Council. But when that does happen, the story is often eerily similar.

On June 27, 2004, nine people enjoying a day at Georgia’s Buford Dam Park huddled under a tree for safety as a storm approached. As the storm drew closer, lightning struck the tree, killing three people and lightly injuring six.

In both Thursday’s and the 2004 strikes, the victims made the mistake of gathering under a tree for shelter during a thunderstorm. This is true for all recent incidents in which three or more people were killed by a lightning strike, and the last time a fatal strike occurred in D.C.

Lightning is not attracted to trees, though it does often strike large trees, as they are typically among the tallest objects in an area. When a bolt hits a tree, the electric charge tends to unleash itself outward in what is called ground current.

Ground current “makes the entire area around a tree dangerous, and anyone standing under or near a tree is vulnerable to this potentially deadly ground current,” said John Jensenius, a specialist at the National Lightning Safety Council. “In addition, for those standing within several feet of a tree, the lightning charge, or a portion of the charge, can jump from the tree directly to the person.”

According to the National Weather Service, ground currents, not direct strikes, cause the most lightning-related deaths and injuries.

Four people were killed in 2002 after funeral-goers in Missouri sought shelter from a storm under a tree, and five were killed in 1994 when a West Virginia family that was out fishing sheltered under a tree as a storm approached.

Trees, unlike safer shelters such as a car or well-built structure, are not sturdy enough to withstand the brunt of a lightning strike. Those sheltering under a tree can be hit by the ground current or a side flash, which is when an electric current jumps from the much taller tree to the people sheltering just feet from its trunk. Cars and well-built homes instead channel the electric current from strikes safely into the ground.

A reminder that lightning is scary and dangerous. ‼️

Powerful lightning strikes can also blow trees apart, turning their wood into potentially dangerous projectiles.

In other parts of the world, multiple-casualty events are not always tied to trees. In Africa, many fatal lightning incidents occur at family farms and schools, according to meteorologist and lightning safety expert Ron Halle.

“In my lighting casualty studies of developing countries, situations often involve schools in Africa that have no lightning protection,” he said.

Last week, seven women were killed by lightning in a market in downtown Kananga in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

When storms are in the forecast, be sure to constantly monitor the weather. If you hear thunder, even if a storm appears to be far away, it is time to stop all outdoor activities and move indoors to safe shelter, not under trees. Thirty minutes after the last sound of thunder, outdoor activities can resume.

46,Stress of climate change is aging lizards before they’re even born,"Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

As temperatures rapidly rise, some lizards are giving birth to young that are already old. In central France, temperatures are accelerating so quickly that many lizards enter the world with DNA that’s already damaged and aged, according to new research published Monday, diminishing their chances of survival. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight The findings add to the growing body of research showing the menace that climate change poses to reptiles and other wildlife as hundreds of thousands of plants and animals are threatened with extinction in a warming world. Hotter summers are not just a human problem: Around the world, heat waves send wildlife scrambling for shade. Scorched vegetation deprives animals of lifesaving cover from predators. In some cases, droughts get so bad that populations die en masse of dehydration.

In the case of the lizards in France, the degradation of DNA over generations may send populations into a death spiral from which they can’t recover. Unlike in “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” the F. Scott Fitzgerald story in which a man ages in reverse, fewer of the lizards “born old” are expected to make it to reproductive age.

“Once you are in this circle of events, it’s quite complicated to come back,” said Andréaz Dupoué‬, a biologist at Ifremer, a research institute in France, and co-author of the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “It can become a vicious circle.”

Dupoué‬’s team focused on a species called the viviparous lizard, or the common lizard. Despite the “common” in its name, the two-inch critter does something uncommon among reptiles: It can both lay eggs and give live birth.

For more than a decade, his team traveled around France’s Massif Central mountains sampling blood from the lizards’ eyes and clipping off tiny pieces of their tails, in an effort to catalogue the genetic material of hundreds of individuals.

With many lizards lounging in grassy areas, “they are not quite difficult to catch,” Dupoué‬ said.

In the lab, the team measured caps at the ends of the lizards’ chromosomes called telomeres. Like a hem at the edge of a piece of fabric, telomeres shield the rest of the DNA from fraying or tangling.

But the caps wear away as the body ages, until they can no longer provide protection. The stresses of life — including rising temperatures — can trim telomeres prematurely.

Newborn lizards in declining, heat-stressed populations had abnormally stubby telomeres, Dupoué‬ and his colleagues found. As female lizards living in hotter places potentially pass their shortened telomeres to their offspring, damaged chromosomes may accumulate across generations and drive populations down.

As temperatures rise, the problem may only accelerate.

“The most relevant result of the paper is the detection of a very worrying tendency towards shorter telomeres — and thus, faster aging — in populations exposed to the more demanding climatic conditions for the species,” said Germán Orizaola, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Oviedo in Spain who was not involved with the latest research. Such populations, Orizaola said, are “at higher risk of extinction.”

France is already one of the fastest-warming places in the world. This summer, the heat in Europe has been so intense that Tour de France organizers sprayed water on roads to keep them from “melting.” The French government warned that the nation is facing its “most severe drought” ever recorded.

Of the 10 lizard populations the researchers examined in France, one disappeared during the course of the study.

“It was quite sad, actually,” Dupoué‬ said. “It’s something that is really happening at a rapid pace.”

The viviparous lizard, which is found from Ireland to Japan, is not at risk of vanishing any time soon. The species is hardy, and so well adapted for colder climates that it can freeze for the winter and survive.

But many other reptiles are in danger of extinction. More than a fifth of all reptile species are threatened, a research team found this year, with turtles and crocodiles among the most imperiled.

Advertisement

There’s a silver lining, though, not just for lizards but for all sorts of wildlife: Measuring the lengths of telomeres could become a tool that helps biologists figure out if conservation efforts are working, Dupoué‬ said. It may even help scientists spot species in distress before it’s too late.

“We could just sample the individuals in the populations and diagnose the lengths,” he said. “And we can say, ‘Okay, this one is good; this one is in really bad shape.’ ”

47,How a four-day workweek could be better for the climate,"Listen 7 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Reducing the workweek to four days could have a climate benefit, advocates say. In addition to improving the well-being of workers, they say slashing working hours may reduce carbon emissions. It’s what you might call a “potential triple-dividend policy, so something that can benefit the economy, society and also the environment,” said Joe O’Connor, chief executive of the nonprofit group 4 Day Week Global. “There are not many policy interventions that are available to us that could potentially have the kind of transformative impact that reduced work time could have.”

Over the years, studies have documented a link between fewer working hours and lower emissions — reductions that experts explain may be the result of changes to commuting, energy use and lifestyle habits. One analysis of data looking at more than two dozen countries from 1970 to 2007 predicted that if work hours were reduced by 10 percent, there could be drops in ecological footprint, carbon footprint and carbon dioxide emissions by 12.1 percent, 14.6 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.

“The one thing we do know from lots of years of data and various papers and so forth is that the countries with short hours of work tend to be the ones with low emissions, and work time reductions tend to be associated with emission reduction,” said Juliet Schor, an economist and sociologist at Boston College who researches work, consumption and climate change.

For instance, reducing working hours could affect people’s lives outside of work, said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. He suggested this kind of change could lead people toward more environmentally friendly habits. “They become used to a different lifestyle that’s a lower consumption lifestyle because they have more time.”

But those benefits would depend on a number of factors, experts emphasize, including how people choose to spend nonworking time. It’s also critical, they said, to remember that reducing working hours is just one strategy to combat climate change.

“There’s no one arguing that the four-day workweek is a silver bullet that will address all of our environmental concerns in one go — far from it,” O’Connor said. “But can it be a very powerful enabler and a very powerful contributor? I think absolutely it can.”

Commuting and travel

Transportation is the biggest contributor to greenhouse emissions, Schor said, “and commuting is a big part of that.”

In 2020, the transportation sector accounted for about 27 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The potential benefits of cutting down on commuting and travel were perhaps most noticeable during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. When widespread stay-at-home orders were in place, the emissions from driving, flying and industrial output were dramatically reduced. Air quality in cities around the world showed marked improvement, while global emissions plummeted.

Largely fueled by the pandemic, a widespread adoption of remote and hybrid work models may mean many are already commuting less even if they work five days a week, O’Connor said — but officially adopting a four-day workweek could benefit industries that are still largely in-person.

A November 2021 survey of 2,000 employees and 500 business leaders in the United Kingdom found that if all organizations introduced a four-day week, the reduced trips to work would decrease travel overall by more than 691 million miles a week.

But the climate benefits of less commuting could be negated, experts said, if people choose to spend their extra time off traveling, particularly if they do so by car or plane.

Schor said it’s important for people to ask themselves: “What are they going to be doing on the fifth day, and what is the energy use associated with that, and how does it compare to what they would have been doing?”

Energy usage

Shorter working hours could lead to reductions in energy usage, experts said.

According to a 2006 paper, if the United States adopted European work standards, the country would consume about 20 percent less energy. And if Europeans gave up those shorter workweeks, the authors wrote they would “consume some additional 25 percent more energy.”

“There’s a definite relation between production, consumption and carbon emissions,” said Weisbrot, who co-wrote the 2006 paper.

Energy could also be conserved if less resources are needed to heat and cool large office buildings, Schor said, reducing demands on electricity.

When the Utah state government launched a four-day workweek trial among its employees in 2008, one report projected that shutting down buildings on Fridays would lead to a decrease of at least 6,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, Scientific American reported.

Any potential energy-saving gains, however, hinge on how companies and individuals use resources, Schor said.

For example, if an entire workplace shuts down on the fifth day, that would help lower consumption — less so if the office stays open to accommodate employees taking different days off. Energy consumption could also increase overall if people spend their day off at home or elsewhere doing activities that would use more resources than if they were at work.

Lifestyle changes

It’s possible that fewer working hours may lead some people to have a larger carbon footprint, but experts say research suggests that most people are likely to shift toward more sustainable lifestyles.

“The majority view coalesces around the idea that intense working often leads to intense living,” O’Connor said. “By offering people additional time back, you’re enabling people to have more time to make sustainable life choices.”

One theory, Schor said, is that people who work more and have less free time tend to do things in more carbon-intensive ways, such as choosing faster modes of transportation or buying prepared foods. “Convenience is often carbon-intensive and people opt for convenience when they’re time-stressed.”

Meanwhile, some research suggests that those who work less may be more likely to engage in traditionally low-carbon activities, such as spending time with family or sleeping.

“When we talk about the four-day workweek and the environment, we focus on the tangible, but actually, in a way, the biggest potential benefit here is in the intangible,” O’Connor said. “It’s in the shift away from a focus on hard work to a focus on smart work. It’s the cultural change in how we work and the impact that could have on how we live, and I think that that’s the piece that’s really revolutionary.”

But moving to widely reduce working hours should not be done in isolation, he and other experts said.

“It doesn’t matter how many days you work if we’re still using fossil fuels,” Schor said.

48,"What’s driving the massive, destructive rainfalls around the country","Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

At one weather station in Fairbanks, Alaska, each hour of rainfall is about 50 percent more intense, on average, than it was a half-century ago. The Wichita area is experiencing rains about 40 percent more fierce these days. Huntington, W.Va., and Sioux City, Iowa, are seeing deluges roughly 30 percent more extreme than in 1970.

Places around the nation are facing more frequent, more extreme precipitation over time — a reality laid bare once again by the record-shattering rains and catastrophic flooding in eastern Kentucky and St. Louis last week.

The warming atmosphere is supercharging any number of weather-related disasters — wildfires, hurricanes, crippling heat waves. But as it also fuels once-unthinkable amounts of rain in single bursts, the problem of so much water arriving so quickly is posing serious challenges in a nation where the built environment is not only outdated but increasingly outmatched.

“The infrastructure we have is really built for a climate we are not living in anymore,” said Andreas Prein, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) who studies extreme precipitation.

From populated cities to rural outposts, the United States has long struggled with antiquated sewage and wastewater networks, outdated bridges and crumbling roads and culverts. But as more water falls from the sky more quickly in many places, those challenges have become only more urgent.

“What happened was way more than the system — any system — can handle,” Sean Hadley, spokesman for the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, said of the recent storms that dumped more than 9 inches of rain there in a matter of hours, shattering the previous daily record from 1915.

The record-crushing rain in St. Louis inundated storm drains and creeks. Sewage backed up into homes. The River des Peres swelled beyond its banks. The area’s sprawling drainage systems, parts of which date to the 19th century, were quickly overwhelmed.

“It was just too much water,” Hadley said.

An analysis of weather data by the nonprofit group Climate Central found that nearly three-quarters of locations the group examined around the country have experienced an increase in the amount of rain falling on their annual wettest day since 1950 — particularly along the Gulf Coast and Mid-Atlantic. The numbers show that 2021 was a record-setting year for extreme rainfall events, with dozens of places logging their wettest day in generations.

A separate Climate Central report this spring found that of 150 locations the group analyzed, 90 percent now experience more average rainfall per hour, compared with 1970. Those increasing bursts of extreme precipitation carry profound economic and human health risks, the likes of which have been on display most recently in eastern Kentucky.

Jen Brady, a data analyst for Climate Central, said many places around the country are getting roughly the same, or in some cases, less rain annually than in the past. But it is the sudden, relentless rainfalls that are contributing to flash floods and other problems.

“The damage that’s happening doesn’t show up when you just look at [annual] precipitation records. It matters if you get 2 inches a day, versus 2 inches an hour,” Brady said. “Our infrastructure is not designed to hold that much water in that much time.”

Scientists say there is little doubt about what is driving the shift toward more frequent, more devastating rains: climate change.

“Individual events happen all the time and have happened all the time in our historical record. We need to be aware that just because we have an event doesn’t mean it represents something unusual,” said Kenneth Kunkel, an atmospheric sciences professor at North Carolina State University.

But while it remains difficult for researchers to outline the precise climate fingerprint on specific summer thunderstorms and other heavy-rain events, they are increasingly able to detail the climate impact on massive tropical cyclones such as Hurricane Harvey. What’s more, after decades of observing and analyzing precipitation metrics around the country, Kunkel says the numbers tell a clear story of change.

“There’s no doubt that the frequency and intensity of the extreme rainfall events is increasing,” Kunkel said, adding that the trend is especially strong in the eastern and central United States.

“When I started 30 years ago, a [climate] signal was emerging,” he said. “That signal has gotten stronger and stronger. … The data are pretty definitive in showing that.”

The explanation boils down to what Kunkel calls “basic physics.” For every degree Fahrenheit that the air temperature increases, the atmosphere can hold about 4 percent more water.

The world already has warmed more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since preindustrial times. That increased heat means more moisture in the air — in the United States, much of which comes off the Gulf of Mexico — and more fuel for more intense rainstorms.

“We’ve had an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, … so we are seeing more of these heavy rainfall events,” said David Easterling, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. “This is all very consistent with the notion of a warming atmosphere.”

It’s not that St. Louis, for instance, hasn’t had heavy rainstorms in the past. But these days, Easterling said, that same storm likely has access to a lot more moisture that can become torrential rain.

“What was really highly unusual 100 years ago is not that unusual anymore,” he said.

More heavy rains alone don’t automatically translate to more flooding. It matters whether the soil where rain falls is dry or already saturated, how populated the area is and whether the water has someplace to go.

In an urban area like St. Louis, the sheer amount of paved surfaces contributed to runoff that overwhelmed drainage systems. In eastern Kentucky, the steep terrain funneled cataclysmic amounts of water to flatter areas below, where most homes and people are.

No matter the geography, the more intense rains are posing a major planning, engineering and adaptation challenge on the ground.

One problem is that the country’s flood mapping and its collection of precipitation data are underfunded and outdated, and have long relied on “a very patchwork approach,” said Chad Berginnis, executive director for the Association of State Floodplain Managers.

That means engineers, planners and public works officials don’t always have access to the most accurate and up-to-date data about current risks — and those probably on the horizon.

Berginnis said some local governments with more resources — places such as Milwaukee, Nashville and Charlotte — have undertaken research to understand and plan for the water-related challenges they face. New York City also has invested in its own studies and in measures to better gird itself against heavier rains and rising seas.

“They are going to see less damage going forward,” Berginnis said. But not every place is so fortunate.

“In rural areas or places that have less capacity, they are stuck with the data that is nationally available, and it’s just not that good,” he said. “Unfortunately, it’s kind of the haves and the have-nots in a lot of cases.”

The problem of more frequent and extreme precipitation is not only national but also global. Europe saw deadly flooding after severe rains last summer. Parts of Australia have endured tremendous rainfall in recent days, putting Sydney on track for its wettest year on record. Parts of China have experienced devastating floods this summer, fueled by rainfall that, at least in one area, dumped 3.3 inches in a single hour.

Across the globe, the torrents show few signs of slowing.

The federal government’s most recent National Climate Assessment found that, over the coming century, “observed increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events in most parts of the United States are projected to continue.” The largest increases in intense precipitation events have occurred — and are expected to continue — in the Northeast and Midwest.

“These trends are consistent with what would be expected in a warmer world, as increased evaporation rates lead to higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere, which in turn lead to more frequent and intense precipitation extremes,” scientists wrote.

That same assessment found that the nation’s water systems “face considerable risk even without anticipated future climate changes.” But with the changes, the risk will rise for dams and levees at risk of failure, for landslides and erosion on the West Coast, for more flooding in low-lying areas of the Midwest and Southeast, and more strain on old and overtaxed infrastructure in the Northeast.

For now, extreme precipitation events are likely to get only more extreme and more common unless the world makes rapid and drastic cuts in planet-heating emissions — something that has yet to materialize.

Prein, the NCAR scientist, said that even if the world halts warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) beyond preindustrial levels — a core aim of the Paris climate accord — rain and flood events are still likely to get worse in the near term.

“We cannot just shut down our greenhouse gas emissions immediately,” he said. “We will see these events become more intense in the next couple of decades, and there is very little we can do about that.”

That’s why investing in effective adaptation efforts and early warning systems is essential, he said. So is being more cautious about where and how humans build new developments and manage existing infrastructure. Because the heavy rains will come.

“It’s sad but true,” he said, “these kinds of events are our new normal.”

49,"In a New Orleans ward ravaged by climate change, leaders nurture the next generation","The Center for Sustainable Engagement & Development was founded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Now these community leaders are changing the way the Lower 9th Ward can become resilient to natural disaster — and inspiring the next generation along the way.

NEW ORLEANS — Arriving at Bayou Bienvenue, Arthur Johnson swings closed the door of his pickup truck and wipes the sweat across his brow.

“Says it feels like 108 today,” he murmurs.

About this series Climate Visionaries highlights brilliant people around the world who are working to find climate solutions.

The blistering heat doesn’t stand in the way of today’s lesson. As daily afternoon storm clouds roll in, Johnson begins hiking up to a platform on the levee that protects the Lower 9th Ward, trailed by nine interns hoping to learn how they can help address the environmental challenges that have decimated — and continue to threaten — this community.

Johnson is the chief executive of the Center for Sustainable Engagement & Development (CSED), also known as Sustain the Nine, a nonprofit that was formed after Hurricane Katrina to revitalize the badly damaged Lower 9th Ward. The group embraces community as a climate solution, working to teach residents about their environment and how to use science, conservation and sustainable practices to enrich and protect it.

“It’s wetlands, so it’s supposed to be natural,” Johnson says, pointing out various plants the group has planted to prevent soil erosion. “It’s not supposed to be manicured and look so pretty. It’s a natural habitat. The birds and everything you see here — it’s a haven right in your own backyard.”

The levee was rebuilt by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after Katrina, but CSED built the platform atop it in 2009 as a community classroom and gathering place. Johnson says that on any given day, he’ll see photographers, anglers or university students on the platform, taking in a view of the bayou. Johnson and his interns — local teens — test the temperature of the water and the soil.

“This wasn’t built because it was nice to do; it was built for education and experiments,” Johnson says, leaning over one of the platform’s railings. One of the interns points toward his feet on the deck with a device used to measure the temperature of the ground. It reads 150 degrees.

New Orleans is on the front lines of climate change’s wrath, vulnerable in a number of ways, including hotter temperatures and an eroding coastline. More than 90 percent Black, the Lower 9th Ward is a microcosm of a larger truth: Communities of color across the globe often suffer the most from climate change while contributing the least to its causation.

But this group of community activists is changing the way most vulnerable inhabitants of New Orleans can recover and become resilient to natural disaster — aiming to train its young people in ways that can be recreated in other cities, too.

“It’s not a million-dollar program. It’s not a $100,000 program. Hell, it’s not even a $50,000 program,” Johnson says. “But we do a lot with what we have.”

The old house on Chartres Street that serves as the group’s headquarters belonged to an elderly couple who didn’t return after Katrina. It sat empty for eight years until the group petitioned the city to fix it up and allow them to move in, leaving behind the small church office where the group started.

Johnson takes a seat in his office chair on a sweltering Wednesday afternoon, with items including artwork and solar panels piled ceiling-high around him. He was born in Washington and explains that he relocated to New Orleans 12 years ago to rehabilitate the 9th Ward, where his mother is from and where he visited his grandmother “every year since I can remember.”

CSED interns take a lunch break in the backyard of the group’s headquarters.

Johnson was brought onboard by Charles Allen, who co-founded CSED in 2006 along with Pam Dashiell, a resident of the Holy Cross neighborhood and a legendary local climate justice leader. (Dashiell died in 2009.) Dashiell and Allen, who is now the community engagement director at the National Audubon Society, first formed the group to address the immediate aftermath of Katrina, helping to breathe life back into the city and to ensure that what was rebuilt was constructed with sustainability and resilience in mind.

It is difficult to now find any environmental initiative in the Lower 9th Ward in which the group isn’t involved, often partnering with other nonprofit entities, environmental organizations or universities to secure grants and funding.

In May, the group partnered with Glass Half Full, another nonprofit organization, to bring glass recycling to the neighborhood for the first time. With $6,000, CSED built seven public drop-off locations and paid for a year’s service. The glass is converted into sand that is used for disaster relief and coastal restoration in New Orleans.

CSED also works to bring trees from a local Christmas tree drop program to the bayou. The old, dried trees collected with another local group, Common Ground Relief, are bundled and arranged in a pattern to capture sediment. As they degrade, they will become a fish hatchery before decomposing into organic matter that will provide nutrients to the ecosystem.

And in January, CSED established an official space in Metairie, in Jefferson Parish, for a cypress tree nursery, now home to more than 3,000 bald cypresses. Once the trees reach a certain level of maturity — typically around 3½ feet tall — CSED will plant them in the wetlands to reinforce coastal resilience and chip away at the massive loss of trees caused by hurricanes over the years.

Last year, Allen launched the group’s first internship program with the help of Bernard Singleton, a biology professor at nearby Dillard University, an HBCU. Now in its second summer, the program brings in teens for a month, five days a week, to run scientific experiments, study the environment of the Lower 9th Ward and learn from local mentors.

“The nursery, the internship, they — no pun intended — bear fruit. But I think the other win is the commitment and level of confidence that the community has in CSED,” Johnson says over the purr of a stationary fan pointed at his face.

“That’s built over time. There’s a level of trust. That’s something you can’t buy,” he says.

In New Orleans, time can be organized into two eras: before Katrina, and after Katrina — the latter a phrase used so frequently that it begins to sound like one word.

After Katrina, floodwater remained for almost five weeks, destroying everything below its surface — the inundation being the result of years of environmental mismanagement that saw levees fail on an epic scale.

After Katrina, the population of the Lower 9th Ward plunged from just over 14,000 in 2000 to about 4,000 by 2019, according to the Data Center. The average household income dropped from about $40,000 to $34,000.

Allen returned to Holy Cross, his neighborhood in the Lower 9th, on Oct. 9, 2005 — six weeks after Katrina struck and he had evacuated to Birmingham, Ala. After cleaning out his father’s house on Douglass Street, he began attending meetings around town focused on connecting neighborhoods with outside groups, academic institutions and governments willing to help develop small-scale recovery programs.

Today, Allen speaks passionately about finding solutions for those who did return, jumping from ideas about architecture to solar farms to microgrids.

“After Katrina, it’s more of what you call a ‘risk reduction system,’ because you never really eliminate the risk,” says Allen, settling his tall frame into a chair at the CSED headquarters. “It’s all about how we reduce the risk over time.”

In early 2006, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin unveiled the Bring Back New Orleans Commission, whose proposals included leaving certain areas of the city unpopulated. “Their effort kind of fell flat on its face,” Allen says.

“That was kind of disrespectful to a lot of folks that weren’t back yet, that were not able to be on the ground and in those conversations. To be told, ‘Oh, your neighborhood ought to just be a green space,’ ” Allen says. “ ‘Well, I’m not back yet. How can you tell me that?’ ”

Once the city shifted toward neighborhoods and residents leading their own recovery efforts, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources contacted Allen — who was working at Tulane University at the time as assistant director for external affairs — along with Dashiell. The department asked them to put together a strategy to rebuild the community with sustainability and resilience in mind.

Charles Allen, center, co-founded CSED after Hurricane Katrina. Johnson and Bernard Singleton, right, launched the group’s first internship program, in 2021.

Allen says his relationship with Dashiell was a “remarkable one,” with them “serving as sidekicks to one another, trying to cover as much of this work as we possibly could” in the aftermath of Katrina.

“The work back then — going back to 2005, 2006, 2007 — was all about how we pull together resources, money, you name it, to build and rebuild while learning critical lessons from the disaster,” Allen says. “That was the immediate thing, you know? We got to rebuild the levees. We got to rebuild the flood walls.”

In the years following Katrina, CSED took on an additional role in trying to protect the needs of the community as countless outside interests — including tourism companies, book authors and celebrities looking to help out — moved in.

“What we saw was the community was browbeat, because of Katrina, and the loss, and the slowness of recovery. And then they were feeling like they were being used, you know,” Johnson says. “Dissertations, theses, books were all written with people’s comments — people made money on the people here.”

CSED interns gather soil samples and test the air quality near Bayou Bienvenue. CSED interns gather soil samples and test the air quality near Bayou Bienvenue.

In 2010, Allen asked Johnson, a good friend, to help with a grant that required matching funding. With a background in management and fundraising from his time working in medium and large nonprofits, such as the American Heart Association, Johnson agreed.

“I figured that I would come here, I anticipated at most, for three weeks. After the first week, the board asked me whether I would consider staying on permanently.”

With a laugh, Johnson adds, “long story short, I’m still here.”

Johnson has a calm demeanor and a husky voice. People file in and out of the house all day, each one popping their head into his office to say hello. Kids, adults, mentors, interns, volunteers, individuals dropping off lunch, neighbors and politicians stop by, each drawn to his orbit.

“We’ve always been about education. That’s one of our pillars as a community-based nonprofit, the whole idea of being able to share knowledge and expand knowledge to make sure that the community is able to converse and understand.”

When Johnson came on board, he immediately noticed a lack of engagement with residents at local environmental meetings. Experts brought in were speaking at people, not with them, he says. “You had these educator types, scientists, environmentalists — and residents were somewhat intimidated.”

On issues such as sea level rise and storm drain restoration, the center prioritizes keeping the neighbors scientifically informed. Johnson says that over time, residents began to feel comfortable engaging with decision-makers and expressing their concerns at the local, state and federal levels. And government leaders began to hear them.

“We said, ‘Look, if you have these big meetings in school auditoriums, that’s not a good way to get our community — meaning the underserved community and community of color — to hear from them,’ ” he continues. “You really have to go into their environment, and that allows them to feel more comfortable. You’d be more comfortable in your house than you’d be in mine, you know?”

In April, members of the Biden administration visited New Orleans, and Johnson and his staff gave White House environmental officials an “up close and personal look into how issues of environmental justice play out in the New Orleans area,” said Christine Harada, executive director of the Federal Permitting Council, which coordinates federal environmental reviews and select infrastructure projects, in an email. The administration specified “early and meaningful public input — particularly from disadvantaged communities” as part of its process in the Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan, released after the passage of Biden’s infrastructure bill.

“They took us on a tour of the Bayou Bienvenue Wetland Triangle, where we saw firsthand the effects of infrastructure planning that did not prioritize the needs of the surrounding community, leading to devastation in the Lower 9th Ward during Hurricane Katrina,” Harada said. “We are incorporating the lessons learned from our discussions into our permitting work, as we strive to ensure all communities are factored into the federal permitting process at the start of any project.”

After the visit, the Permitting Council invited CSED to its next Environmental Justice Listening Session for Federal Agencies, which takes place this fall.

Johnson says that in the past, the “mistake of the bureaucratic process” has been inaccurate assumptions of what would benefit communities. He says he hopes to convey to the administration the importance of including local perspectives as decisions on climate policies and new developments get the green light. “We’ll be able to be a resource, particularly where the rubber meets the road,” Johnson says. “And particularly as it relates to underserved, overburdened communities of color that don’t always get a voice out there.”

On the day Johnson visits the bayou with his interns, Christina Lehew, a project coordinator, treks down the other side of the platform to the wetlands. She begins pointing to parts of the coast — to birds, to marshland — speaking excitedly about the biodiversity and ideas the group has for preserving it, such as the Christmas tree- and glass-recycling projects.

“That’s the thing about doing environmental science and restoration work — you have to be creative in how you do it, so you end up finding really inspiring solutions,” says Lehew, who began working with CSED last year as a graduate fellow.

After an hour of exploring the bayou, Singleton, the Dillard biology professor, leads the group toward CSED’s outdoor learning center, a couple of football fields away. Built in 2016 in partnership with Tulane University, the center is on land that was ravaged during Katrina.

“The intent was to keep things as natural as possible. We didn’t want to do anything to block off the view [of the bayou] for these homeowners,” says Johnson, referring to a yellow house and a brick house that were renovated after Katrina. “But the homeowners like having us, because of the activity. After Katrina, there was no activity for a while, for years, which brought safety concerns.”

At the center, Singleton watches as one of the interns collects a soil sample and puts it in a small zip-top bag.

“What do you think? Is there lead and arsenic in the soil?” he asks.

“If there used to be a house here, then yeah,” replies the intern, matter-of-factly.

Singleton, a military veteran, returned to New Orleans once he completed his studies and his service. While teaching at Dillard University, his alma mater, he consulted for the city on some of the biggest environmental disasters New Orleans had faced before Katrina. After Katrina hit, Singleton evacuated and was offered a new position in Georgia, but he opted to return.

“I decided I wanted to be a part of bringing New Orleans back,” he says, adjusting the brim of his baseball cap, “U.S. Army veteran” written in faded yellow letters across it.

Johnson and Singleton dreamed up the center’s internship program years ago, which grew from seven students at its launch to nine interns this summer. They listen to lecturers from across the city, including leaders from universities, businesses, law firms, environmental groups and even the New Orleans government.

CSED built the platform atop the levee at Bayou Bienvenue to serve as an outdoor classroom and community gathering place.

“That’s what we’re trying to do with them: Get them out there. Get them comfortable with meeting people and networking. Sharpen their skills of presenting and being able to put together and design a project in their own right,” Singleton says.

In 2016, Singleton notes, only 2.8 percent of all environmental science degrees went to Black Americans.

“The individuals who live in these communities are the ones most affected when there’s a disaster or environmental issue, but they are also the least represented,” he says. “So we’re hopefully influencing them to decide to go into the field of environmental science. But we also emphasize the fact that you can be in any career path and then make a difference in the environment.”

“You see them change. You know, he plays basketball,” Johnson says, referring to a 14-year-old intern. “When he first came to the program, that was basically the one thing he wanted to focus on. Now, he wants to be a scientist and a basketball player. And he can do that.”

The last of the experiments have been completed — or at least, as many as could be done before the heat became too much to bear.

As the group migrates back toward the cars, the student Arthur mentioned begins to describe his ambitious athletic and scientific aspirations, echoing Johnson’s words.

“Yeah, I can do it,” he says, looking down at the bag of soil in his hands. “I can do anything.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com
50,The Senate finally passed a historic climate bill. Now what?,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Welcome back to The Climate 202 after the newsletter took a break last week! Today we have a special edition that looks in-depth at the major climate bill that passed the Senate. We'll be back to our regularly scheduled programming tomorrow. But first: Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight ‘You can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good’: Democrats cheer passage of historic climate bill For decades, it has been virtually impossible to pass major climate legislation through the Senate. That finally changed on Sunday, when Senate Democrats passed their ambitious climate and tax package, a crucial step in a grueling journey to deliver the largest climate investment in U.S. history.

The 755-page piece of legislation, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, cleared the chamber by a vote of 51-50 after nearly 20 hours of debate on the Senate floor, with Vice President Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.

For many climate advocates, the bill is far from perfect. While it contains a record $369 billion in new spending to fight global warming and bolster clean energy, it also includes several provisions that would prolong the life of polluting fossil fuel infrastructure — a concession to Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), the Senate's most conservative Democrat.

But after months of working to secure Manchin's elusive vote, Senate Democrats presented a united front in support of the measure, which they said would still make a significant dent in the emissions that are dangerously heating the Earth.

“You can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told The Climate 202 on Sunday.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), one of the Senate's most vocal climate hawks, agreed.

“This is a planetary emergency, and this is the first time that the federal government has taken action that is worthy of the moment,” said Schatz, who fought back tears as he left the Senate floor after the bill's passage. “Now I can look my kids in the eye and say we're really doing something about climate.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said the bill would enable the United States to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. That would bring the nation within striking distance of President Biden's goal of cutting emissions at least in half over the next decade.

The House plans to return Friday to pass the package. The measure will then head to the White House for Biden's long-awaited signature.

Bernie gets burned on fossil fuels

The package was largely the product of private negotiations between Manchin and Schumer. That means rank-and-file Democrats were not privy to the pair's compromises on fossil fuels, including a requirement for the Interior Department to hold oil and gas lease sales before approving rights-of-way for renewable energy projects on public lands.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, blasted these compromises in a fiery floor speech on Saturday.

“We have got to do everything we can to take on the greed, the irresponsibility, the destructiveness of the fossil fuel industry — not give billions of dollars in corporate welfare to an industry that has been destroying our planet,"" he said.

During the Senate's so-called “vote-a-rama” on Sunday, when any senator had the power to force an amendment vote, Sanders offered proposals that would have stripped any “giveaway” to the fossil fuel industry and reinstated the Civilian Climate Corps, a popular climate program that was dropped from the Manchin-Schumer deal.

However, Democrats united in opposition to the Sanders amendments, saying it was important to keep the deal intact. They also remained largely unified in defeating Republican attempts to force tough votes on climate and other issues.

“Ultimately, there's so many great things in the bill,"" Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who co-sponsored a major cap-and-trade bill that died in the Senate in 2010, told The Climate 202 on Sunday.

“I'm going to finish this bill, take a nap, and then begin the fight to complete the Green New Deal and create a Civilian Climate Corps,"" he added.

The struggle ahead over permitting reform

The deal came in part because Biden, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) agreed to seek and pass new legislation easing the federal permitting rules for pipelines and other infrastructure in the coming months.

The permitting measure would run afoul of the rules governing reconciliation, the process that Democrats used to pass the climate package and avoid a Republican filibuster. Schumer has said the permitting proposal will instead attach to a stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, that Congress will need to pass in September to avoid a government shutdown.

In an interview with our colleague Tony Romm, Schumer acknowledged that the permitting agreement is a “mixed bag” because it could benefit not only fossil fuel projects such as pipelines, but also renewable energy projects and transmission lines needed to carry clean electricity.

“Look, I don't like parts of it,” he said. “But there are parts of it the green people like because it makes permitting green power easier, and red states have been blocking transmission lines where there are places where there is a lot of wind and sun.”

However, it's unclear whether Democrats can secure 10 GOP votes to pass the permitting measure. While Republicans have long called for streamlining the environmental review process for large infrastructure projects, they are reluctant to support a bill tied to Democrats' party-line package.

“I would really love if permitting actually came before reconciliation,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (D-N.D.), who participated in bipartisan energy meetings with Manchin in which they discussed permitting.

In a statement Sunday, Manchin projected confidence that senators would pass the permitting proposal when they return from their August recess.

“We are moving full steam ahead on comprehensive bipartisan permitting reform so we can efficiently and safely bring more domestic energy projects online,” he said. “Congress will pass that legislation next month.”

Donald Trump has hopes to be president again, but he faces a number of legal issues - here's a quick summary of his main challenges.

Handling of White House papers

Mr Trump took government documents home to Mar-a-Lago when he left office. Under the Presidential Records Act, removing official records may constitute a criminal offence.

Riots at the US Capitol

The former president stands accused of inciting an ""insurrection"" when he made unfounded claims of election fraud. The events that led to the Capitol riots are still being investigated and could lead to criminal charges.

Election interference

Did Trump try to tamper with the state of Georgia's election results? A phone call he made saying ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" is the focus of an investigation.

Financial affairs

Tax and bank fraud allegations in New York have been pored over by lawyers for years. One of the alleged crimes includes inflating the value of assets to obtain loans, a type of fraud which can carry prison sentences.

Sexual misconduct

Columnist E Jean Carroll accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s - his response of ""It never happened, OK?"" and calling her a liar has led to a defamation case scheduled for 2023.
